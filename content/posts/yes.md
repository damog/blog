<p>I just told my boss. I&#8217;m moving to Venezuela. It&#8217;s now official. Everybody knew, except for my boss and he supports me completely: He rocks. Well, it somewhat depends on the definition of &#8216;moving&#8217;, but I&#8217;ll be there for more than a couple of months, call it whatever you want.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited. Time to get tickets. And time to plan actually, again, <em>going</em> to DebConf, which is, from an specific point of view, quite funny <img border="0" alt="Laughing" src="http://www.damog.net/blog/wp-admin/mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-laughing.gif"/>.</p>

<p>For all of them who have asked me for some spare space at my place in Mexico City, it&#8217;ll be available from May 4th to 24th. But feel free to mail me or drop a line on IRC if you need some space <em>somewhere</em> before or after that period, I have plenty of friends (both geeky and not <img border="0" alt="Tongue out" src="http://www.damog.net/blog/wp-admin/mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif"/>) who would like to host people for a few days.</p>

<p>Now, should I start a petition online in order to abrotman gets decided and come to DebConf?  <img border="0" alt="Wink" src="http://www.damog.net/blog/wp-admin/mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-wink.gif"/></p>
