<p>&#8230;<a target="_blank" href="http://spradu.blogspot.com/2006/02/mandatory-reply.html">you</a> are saying Iran or Somalia are <strong>less important</strong> countries? Does the importance matter here? Are you minimizing them because of a strong reason or because you can&#8217;t drink on them since they are not <strong>important countries</strong>? Why not visit them? If I had enough funds, I&#8217;d do it.</p>

<p>Hey, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debian.org/devel/leader">DPL</a>, do you approve travel expenses for me to visit Iran or Somalia?</p>
