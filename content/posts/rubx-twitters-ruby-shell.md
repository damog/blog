She listens when you talk to her and when you do, it'll better be with Ruby: She will interpret your tweet in Ruby and reply to you with what your code returns.

How does it work? You send a message to her:
<blockquote><tt>@rubx "The day I was born it was a " &lt;&lt; Time.local(1984, "aug", 8).strftime("%A")</tt></blockquote>
And @<a href="http://twitter.com/rubx">rubx</a> will reply:
<blockquote><tt>@damog "The day I was born it was a Wednesday"</tt></blockquote>
Go see more about her (examples, FAQ, etc) on <a href="http://axiombox.com/rubx">axiombox.com/rubx</a> or on her <a href="http://twitter.com/rubx">Twitter profile</a>.

As we tested the hack, a bunch of people started interacting with Rubx too, <a href="http://twitter.com/anibalrojas/status/1455257553">some people</a> calling her <em>Twitter Line Interface Ruby Interpreter</em>! :). See what other people has tried with her <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%40rubx">here</a>.
