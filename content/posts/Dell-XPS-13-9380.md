Got myself a XPS 13" [9380](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-xps-13/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop?appliedRefinements=302) that Dell just released as "Developer Edition" with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS pre-installed. They _just_ released it on January 2019.

Ubuntu didn't last long though. I prefer OS X Mojave than any of the Ubuntu installations. It's okay though, it's just not for me.

Big big *big* shoutout to [Jérémy Garrouste](https://twitter.com/JeremyGarrouste?lang=en) for [his documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Dell/Dell_XPS_13_9380) only a few days ago of the Debian installation for Buster on the laptop which helped me figure out I needed to upgrade the BIOS to fix a couple of issues and be able to run the `d-i` alpha 5 with the Atheros drivers. Time to dust a few things here and there :)

Well that's not a picture of the alpha `d-i` but from the first time I tried to install before upgrading the BIOS.
