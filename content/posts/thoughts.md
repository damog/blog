The sun is hitting my back.<br/><br/>
I vaguely can see the screen.<br/><br/>
I&#8217;m thirsty.<br/><br/>
I&#8217;m too lazy to move to shadow.<br/><br/>
I&#8217;m too lazy to go to the minimarket and buy beer or juice.<br/><br/>
I <strong>really</strong> miss some good food.<br/><br/>
I like people arriving to Helsinki from all over the world.<br/><br/>
Anibal has just arrived and he is with his bags in the reception.<br/><br/>
Holger has been in his chair for the last two days.<br/><br/>
Sauna is too nice and it makes me sweat without even been tired.<br/><br/>
I have been with hangover for the last two days.<br/><br/>
Everybody loves Amaya.<br/><br/>
I have been approved by Ganneff and I&#8217;m just waiting for my account to be created.<br/><br/>
I like my red-black socks.<br/><br/>
Amaya hit Mark Shuttleworth in the face with a frisbee.<br/><br/>
Gunnar snors a lot and loudly.<br/><br/>
Finland is very far away from home.<br/><br/><br/>
