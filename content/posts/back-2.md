<p>Yeah, we are almost two weeks back now, but until now I can feel we are done with lots of pending issues.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, I left <a href="http://debconf7.debconf.org/" target="_blank">DebConf</a> on Saturday morning, arrived NYC on the afternoon where Raquel was waiting for me. By Sunday, we had the very nice chance to meet with <a href="http://damog.net/files/pics/abrotman-cakebutt.jpg" target="_blank">abrotman</a>, rcox and <a href="http://vireo.org/%7Estew/blog" target="_blank">stew</a>. We stayed at stew and rcox’s place until Tuesday, when we got back. We also had the chance to meet with people that we have been working for remotely.

We were walking around in NYC, and suddenly, the 5th avenue became multicolor. It was the gay pride parade. You can take a look at the pics on the <a href="http://damog.net/gallery" target="_blank">gallery</a>, lots of gay people. Our visit to NYC was pretty gayish actually, since we spent our first night in Chelsea, presenced an electronic music festival or similar for lesbians, and the next day, first row on the parade :-)

<p align="left">And that’s it, since we came back until like yesterday, life was a mess; lots of work pending to deliver and many other issues. Finally, we are right now settled up again, enjoying a cold rainy nice weather in Mexico City with <a href="http://damog.net/files/pics/victoria.jpg" target="_blank">very cheap beer</a> (compared with UK pints!) and loved people :-)</p>

Thanks to all who made such a wonderful DebConf, even that, in my case, I arrived late and left early, it was just great (thanks also to MJ Ray, specially; and also to all people who was worried about my arrival, you know who you are, thanks). Thanks also to Mike and Rachel who hosted us, they are a very nice couple. And also, thanks to Alex who joined us in NYC, coming from Philadelphia, spent a nice day with us, took us to Chinatown and Little Italy and gave me a Phillies baseball cap (just as exchange of the worldwide famous <a href="http://damog.net/files/pics/abrotman.jpg" target="_blank">umbrella hat</a>). </p>
