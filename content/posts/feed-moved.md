I have always been <em>against</em> <a href="http://feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>. I don't like it at all. I've never liked it, as a matter of fact, I have no actual idea why I've been using it on my blog. I do know why I used it on the country feeds on <a href="http://planetalinux.org">Planeta Linux</a>, and that is because it was very easy to mask all of our URL changes with some level of stability on the subscribers (in times where me being technically competent was a bad joke for myself). Plus, we could plug AdSense into it (that later on I removed because I like to earn actual dollars, not pennies, <em>you cheap clickers</em>!). Or maybe I'm just so against it because of pure jealousy: A few RSS feed geeks, <em>like myself</em>, sold a <strong>sub-par</strong>product to Google in a <strong>hundred million dollars</strong>. At the very end, I've never had a good reason to use FeedBurner or to stick with it, so hereby I'm dropping it entirely from my own personal blog.

It's obvious that some people who subscribed to my feed using that FeedBurner URL aren't reading this very blog post. It's alright, I've lost reigns before, I will get over it and conquer their hearts again. But you, dear blog reader, planet subscriber, or eventual visitor, have the power to change things, to help workaround the evils of FeedBurner and make me be myself again. Please, help me myself again! And that is, from now on, use this feed URL and only this feed URL, I promise I will support as long as nice good looking HTTP servers (such as <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/webserver">Cherokee</a>) exist:
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://stereonaut.net/feed">http://stereonaut.net/feed/</a></h3>
That said, <strong>I will get you a beer</strong> next time we meet each other and you, dear reader, mention this blog post and mention that you changed to this new feed URL of mine. <strong>I'm not kidding</strong>. Just go ahead and tell me :-)

Thank you.
