<p>If you support friendship, you should sign now the DebConf6&#8217;s abrotman petition!</p>

<p>DO IT NOW!</p>

<p>Alexander Brotman is a nice guy from Philadelphia, US, who is unsure on coming for DebConf6 since he feels he doesn&#8217;t fit the nature of the event. He is a great supporter of the Debian community and he shouldn&#8217;t miss the chance to have an official DebConf so near from home. Besides, he is my friend, think on the kittens :&#8217;)</p>
