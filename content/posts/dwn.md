<p>I was very happy to see my name on the <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly">Debian Weekly News</a> <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2004/27/">yesterday</a> announcing the IRC meeting for the Debian Control Center (or Centre, ;-).</p>

<p>It seems that lots of people is getting interest on this issue. I&#8217;m working on the talk schedule for Sunday, I&#8217;ll publish it soon, I hope today.</p>
