Well, I have just built a very little application, inspired by three main things:


- [mathomatic](http://www.mathomatic.org/) which is a wonderful computer algebra system.
- The fact that I have always to do this by hand.
- The taste of pork :-)

That's how I bring to life: *gChicharronero*.

gChicharronero is a little GNOME application to calculate the values of _x_ in a square equation.

I'm not releasing this because it is still too young and it doesn't do much. My idea is to, after A, B and C values are inputted, graph the substitutions on the complete equation and bring results of _x_. I mean, something nice, something useful, not just some crappy program.

I'll release gChicharronero as soon as it:

- Handles complex numbers without problems.
- Draws the substitutions on the equations.
- wishlist: Graph probable values for _y = f(x)_.

Why the name of gChicharronero? That is because the main formula for solving square equations is called that way by children in Mexico :-)
