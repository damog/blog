I recently stumbled upon <a href="http://feathercast.org/">FeatherCast</a>, a nice little project made by <a href="http://wooga.drbacchus.com/">Rich Bowen</a> and David Reid, the former, a recognized documenter within the Apache community, author of a few <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Rich%20Bowen">books</a> on the webserver, mainly the <a href="http://www.apache-cookbook.com/">Apache Cookbook</a>. FeatherCast is an unofficial podcast; its primary goal is supporting the <a href="http://apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a> community. I've found it to be greatly interesting, modern and up to date; more recently, bringing lights to some of the content and people, for instance, featured on <a href="http://www.us.apachecon.com/c/acus2008/">ApacheCon</a>, which took place in New Orleans, LA, late last year.

Great effort, great initiative: Subscribe and support FeatherCast!
