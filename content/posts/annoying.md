<p>Isn’t it annoying  to syndicate a feed, any kind (RSS, RDF, OPML, Atom) and the new is only a few lines long? It is not the entire blog entry, only a few words. I hate that, it makes you decide between:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the RSS reader to the Trash bin and visit the website.</li>
<li>Piss off the coder of the feed.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If I’m using a reader, I obviously will prefer the second option. So, why would I be using a damn feed reader? </p>
