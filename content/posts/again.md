<p>And continuing with the pictures stuff. Here I found a very nice photograph of a couple of <em>lancheros</em> from Acapulco, bathing in the beach, relaxing from the <em>microbusero</em> work. <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"/> Probably doing the only thing they know: Complain and get drunk.
