The documentation for the [Facebook Messenger API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform) points out how to setup your initial bot [webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference#setup). I just [committed](https://github.com/damog/facebook-messenger-perl/commit/925851fad5c09d644aee7b78d8eb644e5464e401) a quick patch that would make it very easy to setup a quick script to get it done using the *unreleased and still in progress* Perl's [Facebook::Messenger::Bot](https://github.com/damog/facebook-messenger-perl):

    use Facebook::Messenger::Bot;

    use constant VERIFY_TOKEN => 'imsosecret';

    my $bot = Facebook::Messenger::Bot->new(); # no config specified!
    $bot->expect_verify_token( VERIFY_TOKEN );
    $bot->spin();

This should get you sorted. What endpoint would that be, though? Well that depends on how you're giving Facebook access to your Plack's `.psgi` application.
