So <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianNYC">Debian-NYC</a>, mainly the <a href="http://debconf10.debconf.org/">DebConf10</a> local team, organized a workshop for people interested on Debian packaging. The nice people of <a href="http://drop.io">drop.io</a> offered their handy location in Brooklyn.

So this is the first attempt to bring new comers to Debian aiming DebConf10 next summer. <a href="http://riseup.net">Micah</a> and <a href="http://fifthhorseman.net/">dkg</a> are the ones leading the workshop so far.
