<p>As it was expected, I moved from MovableType crazyness into <a href="http://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>. Ha, so this is now a tumblelog (the world of Intenet sometimes amazes me :P).</p>
<p>And as it was expected I brough Blog::Normalize::Tumblr into life. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~damog/" target="_blank">Blog::Normalize</a> is becoming a nice little toy I like to play with. My imported data came from MovableType which was came from Wordpress. Cleanly enough, I&#8217;d be able to export Tumblr posts (or categories/tags or anything else in the future) into Wordpress again and that&#8217;d be a nice circle.</p>
<p>B::N::Tumblr was made, differently from the other blogging systems modules I created before, by scrapping, that&#8217;s the transparency that the model of B::N would give users and developers. After I made the whole scrapping work, and by tracing my HTTP traffic, I realized that Tumblr has an API which allows to read and write posts, lol. I&#8217;d be starting using it soonish and creating WWW::Tumblr, maybe even today. <a href="http://www.textmotion.org" target="_blank">TextMotion</a> support is also on the way. </p>
<p>B::N 0.0rc2 should be mirrored by CPAN soon. </p>
