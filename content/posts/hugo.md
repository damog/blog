I've migrated this blog to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I can't believe how incredibly fast it is. Processing roughly 1400 of my posts takes it roughly 330ms. No other static site processor has ever been this fast with so much of my content.

Now the entire repo is [here](https://github.com/damog/blog).
