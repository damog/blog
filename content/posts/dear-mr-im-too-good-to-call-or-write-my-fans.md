<p>Or&#8230; Dear Mr. &#8220;I&#8217;m too good to make things properly for portability on Ruby packages&#8221;.</p>

<p>Lucas Nussbaum did a great job on the pkg-ruby-extras team by writing the web page called <a target="_blank" href="http://pkg-ruby-extras.alioth.debian.org/upstream-devs.html"><em>Upstream developers, be nice to distribution (re) packagers</em></a>, where he notes the problems we have brought by RubyGems, broken install.rb, extconf.rb, etc. and the like.</p>

<p>Thanks, Lucas!</p>
