My blog has served me throughout the years as a getaway medium. I've found comfort writing its pages, and more recently, writing a little bit more of my technical life and whereabouts. The personal side of it, in spite of being very well handled in the past, has been left behind in recent times. And I believe [Twitter](http://twitter.com) has taken that part of my postings. However, I believe that a lot of the thing I'm currently doing in my life are based on the measurable fact of the impact or weight that those actions would have on my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mrdamog) (and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/damog) for that matter) stream and contacts. This has also prevented me from developing further interests and getting deep into more interesting or worthwhile affairs. All the time spent reading and watching what others are doing, what I'm not doing and show what I do or pretend I'm doing has affected social relationships of mine and, as said, damaged, my growing or professional aspiring persona, that it even hurts deep down.

2010 marks the beginning of a lot of stuff and new plans, as usual. But it also marks the end of that ill poison I'm usually infected with. I want to grow up and move on to more interesting matters, retake the life I'm supposed to live and spend with the people I deserve.

Here, then, is for 2010.
