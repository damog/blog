What an absolute shit show 2020 has been, am I right?

It's definitively been one crazy ride. I started blogging and writing a private journey, actually. It's on Google Docs and it worked quite well even though there has nothing new on that for about six months. This post also serves as a simple proof that this blog is still alive and that I still intend to keep it updated.

For the time being, stay home, keep distanced from others and wear a mask.
