[We](http://raquelhernandez.net)'ll be attending [The Killers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers)' concert tonight. I'm not completely fan of their synthesized-rock-indie music, but she likes them so much and she made me dig their last album, *Sam's Town*, like a thousand times in the car; so I acceded and bought the tickets online. She was even jealous of a friend who is also attending, heh :)

I wasn't happy at all since they are still a more or less new band, they only have two albums released and prices for tickets were high as hell (ironic), but her surprise smile worth it, it definitively does. ;)
