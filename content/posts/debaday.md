I&#8217;ve been working lately on trying to bring back the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday" target="_blank">old debaday</a> effort.<br/><br/>
Debaday was a little nice idea by Andrew Sweger writing a bit of one
different and interesting Sarge package daily, started on March 2004.
In Novembre 2004, his debaday blog died.<br/><br/>
Since January I&#8217;ve been wanting to bring this idea back and last week I finally found some real time to do it.<br/><br/>
The new debaday: <a href="http://debaday.debian.net" target="_blank"><a href="http://debaday.debian.net/">http://debaday.debian.net/</a></a>.<br/><br/>
The hosting is kindly offered by the free comunity, <a href="http://nipl.net" target="_blank">nipl</a>. Thanks, guys. Contributions and any kind of suggestions are appreciated and welcome.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
