<p>Damn, I&#8217;ve been wanting to leave everything done at work, as I can reach Brazil next week without any problems.</p>

<p>So, my little problem of today is:</p>

<p>How can a user validate a file size _before_ uploading it over an HTML/HTTP form?</p>

<p>I can think on JavaScript, but there is a little problem that makes my head twisted: I do not know anything about JS.</p>

<p>Anyway, making some nice research on the WWW about some scripts on this, I haven&#8217;t found anything useful XD. Obviously, this have to be made on the client-side, any intention on validating the file size on the server-side will produce an unnecessary waste of bandwith. And, in the user side, waste of time.</p>

<p>ITOH, I could do nothing of this and say goodbye to DebConf, but that is not a choice ;)</p>

<p>Why do I feel dirty on mood? Because I haven&#8217;t taken a shower since Sunday ;)</p>
