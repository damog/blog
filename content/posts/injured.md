<p>I’m injured. Yesterday, Raquel and me were fooling around and playing, so in the middle of the play, I knelt down, grabbed her legs and put her lap on my left shoulder in order to lift her. So I did.</p>

<p>After carrying her and she screaming “put me down!”, I tried to avoid her from hitting some thing on the ceiling, so I bent to one side wildly, with her still on my shoulder and back and then I felt an awful jab and pain on my back and the whole thorax started to hurt. So, I asked Raquel, who was already safe on ground, to press my thorax in a way to stop pain. It didn’t work out. As we were on our way to the supermarket, driving was painful, even lifting my arms, heavy breathing, etc. When we came back home, I laid in bed for resting and TV watching, but most of my moves were still painful: around 3 hours after the first pain.</p>

<p>I could barely sleep, I couldn’t stay on the same position for a while, but had to change to some other, and it was still painful. At around 3 am, I could sleep a bit better. When I woke up at 7, the pain was still there, but it wasn’t that hard; she woke up and went to the gym. So, I’m resting in bed with a back pain, on a Monday morning. Raquel went to the office after she came back and I feel like an old grandpa.</p>

<p>I will only go see the doctor if the pain is not handleable by tomorrow morning, otherwise I will only spend money that we don’t currently have on drugs and on the doctor’s invoice, and I don’t want to; as stupid as this may seem, I don’t trust doctors. I hope I will be OK by tomorrow and ready to leave to DebConf on Saturday morning.</p>
