<a href="http://google.com">Google</a> created an official <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/google">account</a>. Its <a href="http://twitter.com/google/status/1251523388">first tweet</a> was something odd:

> I'm 01100110 01100101 01100101 01101100 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101100 01110101 01100011 01101011 01111001 00001010

I had <a href="/blog/2007/10/22/tip-perl-del-dia-chr-y-oct-en-un-loop-map/">previously written</a> (in Spanish, for *La Columna de Perl*), how to quickly decode this "way" of binary writing with Perl's `chr` and `oct`. So, to find out what was Google really tweeting, run:

    perl -e 'map { print chr oct "0b".$_; } split /\s/, "01100110 01100101 01100101 01101100 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101100 01110101 01100011 01101011 01111001 00001010";'

So, what's really happening with this snippet? Well, the zeroes-ones string is being passed to the `split` function that explodes the string with a whitespace delimiter and passes that exploded string, a list, to `map`. `map` takes each one of the elements, the 8-character substring, one by one and preppends "`0b`" so that `oct` can understand it as an octal string and returns the value for that character. Then, that value is passed to `chr` that takes the numerical representation of a given character and returns that character. Then, it's just passed to print that, surprise, prints out that value.

How do you do it in your language of choice?
