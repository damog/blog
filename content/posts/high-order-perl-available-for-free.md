My friend [Marco](http://search.cpan.org/~amnesiac/) first told me on IM, then I read it on [PerlBuzz](http://perlbuzz.com/2008/12/09/higher_order_perl_available_for_free_download/). The nice **High-Order Perl** book by [Mark Jason Dominus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jason_Dominus) is now available for free (as in free beer) at its [website](http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/).

This book caught my attention a long time ago on a Barnes & Noble once, but since I had just too many book on queue, I decided not to buy it. I then read that it's actually a good book on *advanced* techniques on Perl, so my interest grew, but for random reasons I just didn't get it.

Now I have no excuses not to, and either do you :)
