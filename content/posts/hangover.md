<p>Well, yesterday a nice crew were on <a href="http://www.tacvbo.net/">Tacvbo&#8217;s</a>, 13 guys drinking beer and sharing some nice moments (as I remember the room on a clock-like turn): p4ola, zerver, <a href="http://www.royald.org/">royald</a>, tuxfer, Odín, Little_Bear, <a href="http://www.mig-29.net/">MiG</a>, Tato, Ramón Carazo, GnuOwned, Juan (AntiloOp&#8217;s cousin) and AntiloOp.</p>

<p>It was nice to meet some guys I have seen on pictures before, or talked on IRC like GnuOwned and AntiloOp.</p>

<p>Anyway I woke up this morning and I was so thirsty, my tongue was dry and my mouth in need of a beer, but I just drank some lemon water which my mom made yesterday: It is so cool that water when you need it, it is refreshing, like seeing a dolphin swim when you are in a boat (I always have associated the fact of a dolphin swimming in the ocean, with refreshing freedom ;)</p>

<p>Today is quite different from other days: There is a hot sun ;) The zone where I go to school and work is very near to the western on Mexico City, very close to Toluca (Toluca is well known as a very old city, its average is below 12&#160;C), and right over there it&#8217;s been cold, raining, etc. So it is nice to see a pure and beautiful sun today.</p>

<p>Two days away from Brazil, and because you all have requested it ;), here is my TODO during my stay there:</p>

<p>o Finish the little port I am making of <a href="http://c.conclase.net/Borland/libreria.php?lib=conio">Borland&#8217;s conio</a> C library, to a well structured and need-fit compliant.</p>

<p>o Help on <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> <a href="http://people.debian.org/%7Eseppy/d-i/translation-status.html">l10n/i18n</a> issues.</p>

<p>o Get involved on <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-desktop/">Debian Desktop Project</a>.</p>

<p>o Get my packages to the Debian Archive.</p>

<p>o Work a little bit on linevents.</p>

<p>o As somebody on the DebConf4 mailing list said: &#8220;Expect the unexpected&#8221; ;-)</p>

<p>o Probably I will find excuses for not to do these and others things :-P</p>
