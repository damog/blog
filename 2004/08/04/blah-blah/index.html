    	<p>I&#8217;ve been working on several things recently.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/dcc" target="_blank" rel="external">dcontrol</a> was requested to change its unix name from dcc to another, since <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-dcc" target="_blank" rel="external">pkg-dcc</a> got uncomfortable about the similarity of both names. We agree, and we are now changing to <em>debcontrol</em>.</p>

<p>* We are migrating files from the old school system we were using at the university into the new one: The one I&#8217;m developing with the other freak guys from the office :-) This is not as easy as it could be thought and I&#8217;m trying to code the script on Ruby. Basically, it has to do these things:<br><br>- Put the old files on the correct places.<br><br>- Generate an SQL scheme for each file.<br><br>- Drop every scheme on PostgreSQL.<br><br>- Code an PHP script to check, when the user logs in the system, if their files were migrated with a 0 status code.</p>

<p>* The other thing I&#8217;m doing at work now is the administration of a web system called <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Moodle</a> (package <a href="http://packages.debian.org/moodle" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>). Moodle is a huge example that good apps can be coded in PHP. Moodle is a virtual learning environment, usually used at school centers, universities, etc. I&#8217;m getting in charge of administering a couple of courses of religious stuff (yes, although I don&#8217;t consider myself a religious person, I&#8217;m enrolled on a school with certain tendency to it -It&#8217;s not very, very bad, at least, the huge amount of money that students pay are destined to something useful-). I do not teach the courses, of course, I&#8217;m just controlling everything :-) So, if I&#8217;m getting paid for using free software (Moodle is licensed under GPL), the least I can do is contribute to the project, so I&#8217;m helping with upstream project: For example, there are still some strings not translated to Spanish, so I translate them -it both helps me on my job, and also to the project-; and stuff like that.</p>

<p>* I&#8217;m getting back to school, with some new course name called Computing and Electronic Engineering, which is more inclined to my professional profile. I&#8217;m getting back to school, on Monday 9th.</p>

<p>* My birthday, as I said in the previous post, is coming a day before school: I&#8217;m getting 20 on 8th. I&#8217;m leaving the <em>1X</em> years, and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s kind of sad. When I was a child I always thought how I would be at 2000 year, almost 5 years ago, I realize that I was 16, and nothing special happened :-) But now, I&#8217;m getting 20, probably the perfect age for leaving home and trying to make myself a little bit more free.</p>

<p>* I have two more packages on the Debian queue, that makes me happy: One was already rejected from ftpmaster like two weeks ago: We (my sponsor and I) had a little glitch on the Architecture: field of the package. One package is a library: libgtk-trayicon-ruby, and the other is a nice logger for physical activities (I&#8217;m geek! I do not sport but hack about sporting, ;-).</p>

<p>Everything seems to be nice and calmed by now. I would like to be just like this every day on my life, because it even gives me time to write all this crap :-)</p>
