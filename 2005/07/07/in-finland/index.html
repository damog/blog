    	<p>My father warned me: &#8216;Be careful with the Paris-CDG airport, it is a madness thing&#8217;.<br><br><br>I was thinking: &#8216;My old man is now too old-fashioned for this time&#8217;.<br><br><br>He was completely right. I almost lost my Paris-Helsinki flight due<br>disorganization on that airport, nobody knew what the gate was, or when<br>the plane was leaving. When somebody told me I had to be at terminal 2D<br>I was a running like a crazy, to not lose the flight, from a terminal<br>to another. Finally get there, and the signs are confusing. I saw a<br>screen and tried to find the Helsinki flight. Nothing. Finally asked in<br>the information desk: Gate 74. Geez.<br><br><br>Upstairs? No, go downstairs, look at the watch, please do not lose the<br>flight. It has been already 30 minutes since the boarding time and 15<br>missing for the plane to leave. Arrived gate 74 of terminal 2D, after a<br>complete security check that even asked me to take my shirt off (the<br>aduana was even lighter). Show my boarding pass (already given to me in<br>Mexico City airport) to the lady. &#8216;Sorry sir, this flight is leaving to<br>Florence&#8217;. &#8216;What? They told me 74 was my gate&#8217;. &#8216;No, see the screen,<br>this gate is leaving to Florence&#8217; (Starting to feel unconfortable and<br>said some bad words to her in Spanish). &#8216;So, what is my gate?&#8217;. She<br>checked on the computer and said: &#8216;Sorry, I have not that information&#8217;.<br>More bad words in Mexican Spanish.<br><br><br>Next gate. Show the boarding pass, &#8216;sorry, this gate is for Milan,<br>London,&#160;!Helsinki,&#160;!Helsinki,&#160;!Helsinki&#8217;. Asked again in an information<br>desk. &#8216;Where the bloody shit is my gate for this boarding pass,<br>Madam?&#8217;. She did not understood my very bad and poor English, I guess<br>so she pointed me with other guy. After reading the boarding pass<br>information: &#8216;Try gate 80, sir&#8217;. &#8216;Try? Are you fucking kidding me?&#8217;. On<br>my way to gate 80, I showed the pass to the lady on that gate. &#8216;Yes,<br>sir, this is the gate&#8217;. Geez, finally. &#8216;Do you have your coupon?&#8217;,<br>&#8216;coupon? What bloody coupon? I don&#8217;t know, take all my papers and let<br>me go&#8217;. &#8216;I cannot let you go in unless you have a coupon&#8217;. Shit. Showed<br>all my papers, even my old passport. I was getting more angry and she<br>was upset because of my mood, also. Finally appeared, is the ticket a<br>coupon? If not, it is for her.<br><br><br>10 seconds later, I was already on the bus that took the last four<br>passengers to the plane. 5 minutes more it closed doors. 7 minutes<br>later, the plane was moving.<br><br><br>Is it normal this thing on Paris-CDG? Maybe it is only a bad<br>experience, but it made me (it still does) mad. Paris would be great<br>for a tourist visit, but no for losing a connection flight. And I<br>didn&#8217;t even see the Eiffel Tower 8-)<br><br><br></p>
