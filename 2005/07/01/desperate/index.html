    	<p>I&#8217;m completely desperate. I just can&#8217;t take life here anymore, and reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/amayita/52618.html">Amaya is leaving tomorrow for Helsinki</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grep.be/blog/2005/06/30#arrived">p2, Wouter and Holger (green hair!) already nearby</a>; makes it only an anxious feeling to leave. Also, I called today <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwolf.org">Gunnar</a>,<br>since he was supposed to give me some shirts to carry to Helsinki (but<br>he won&#8217;t carry too many shirts, so he doesn&#8217;t need my back (still<br>hurts) anymore); he is leaving tomorrow (big fat lucky bastard :-*).<br><br><br>Things at my house are just shit. We live in a shitty place (my mother<br>was just pushed and threatened outside the house, while taking her car<br>of the garage, by a Mr. Nobody, because of some issue with my father,<br>who works as a freelance lawyer). Is this normal? Are we supposed to<br>live with fear of being attacked? Even worst, is it normal for me to<br>see my mother go out for work and fear she (or my sister) get<br>kidnapped? Is this the &#8220;safer place&#8221; our major is talking about almost<br>everyday? Is this the &#8220;different government&#8221; that president Vicente Fox<br>says it is (since five years ago)? Is it so fucking normal to see my<br>mother, who is almost 50, go out for work everyday, and return 8 hours<br>later tired? All this is shit. Really. I&#8217;ll leave as soon as I can.<br><br><br>And in the work the things are not better. I just can&#8217;t take my boss<br>who does not give me any work to do in the last two weeks. Some people<br>could think that that rocks, but not for me. Am I doing something<br>wrong? Am I going to be fired soon? Why is everybody nuts because of<br>the work load and not me? I was not allowed to go to Brazil (<a target="_blank" href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org">FISL</a>)<br>one month ago, because I was at Castell√≥n two months ago, and I&#8217;m going<br>to be at Finland next week, but, all of that is normal? I feel<br>sometimes tied to this company (which yes, they have gave much to me,<br>at least). I&#8217;m working because I need the money for the university, but<br>what if I lose my job? I&#8217;m going to be a 20/21 years old guy without<br>job, without school and completely frustrated.<br><br><br>It is probably summer vacations also. I mean, in the school side. Or<br>the uncertainty of everything. I just have to leave soon (only 5 days<br>left) or I&#8217;ll jump from this building (six floors).<br><br><br>Getting back from Finland, I&#8217;ll just wait a couple of weeks to return<br>to school, that&#8217;ll help. Hopefully. And then, I&#8217;ll start saving for my<br>next trip: <a target="_self" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/">Germany 2006</a>. <br><br><br>Thinking in the future makes life a little less worst.<br><br><br><br></p>
