Lately, I&#8217;ve been listening a lot to a song which completely matches
our night situation here in Finland: Sol de medianoche (Midnight sun)
by Sal√≥n Victoria.<br/><br/>
It&#8217;s a very soft kind of ska, pretty romantic, made in Mexico City. If you are interested, grab it from <a href="http://xrl.us/grjb" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/><br/>
