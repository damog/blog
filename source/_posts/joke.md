<p>A man and a woman who had never met before, but were both married to other people, found themselves assigned to the same sleeping room on a transcontinental train. Though initially embarrassed and uneasy over sharing a room, they were both very tired and fell asleep quickly&#8230; he in the upper bunk and she in the lower.</p>

<p>At 1:00 AM, the man leaned over and gently woke the woman saying, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m sorry to bother you, but would you be willing to reach into the closet to get me a second blanket? I&#8217;m awfully cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a better idea,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Just for tonight, let&#8217;s pretend that we&#8217;re married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! That&#8217;s a great idea!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Get your own fucking blanket.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment of silence, he farted.</p>
