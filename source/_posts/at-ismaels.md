<p>Yesterday I was at <a href="http://www.olea.org/">Ismael Olea</a>&#8217;s course, organized by <a href="http://www.upn.mx/">UPN</a>, talking about technical documentation, and editing stuff. It was quite interesting how he can point to some specific needed issues. This issues are commonly mistakes of the writers, the coders, the speakers, everybody involved on linguistics.</p>

<p>We had the first class yesterday, it will happen in several days, four hours each. And yes, his Spanish is somewhat difficult to understand, he is an Andaluz, I can&#8217;t really understand the difference between all that Spanish provinces, but for example, I remember I _could_ understand and talk very nice with <a href="http://www.amayita.com/">Amaya</a> and <a href="http://www.hispalinux.es/%7Edata">Jesús</a>, even with <a href="http://www.alobbs.com/">Álvaro</a>, but Ismael is so different. Maybe it is the same when they talk with a guy from Veracruz, a guy from Mexico Shitty ;-P, or from Chihuahua.</p>

<p>Anyway it is always nice to meet the crew: Good friends were at the course.</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="http://www.gwolf.cx/">Gunnar</a> has made my advocation for the <a href="http://nm.debian.org/">NM</a> queue of Debian. <a href="http://nm.debian.org/nmstatus.php?email=damog%40damog.net">Here</a> is my status page. I hope I could get my goal before 2005.</p>
