I&#8217;m completely desperate. I just can&#8217;t take life here anymore, and reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/amayita/52618.html">Amaya is leaving tomorrow for Helsinki</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grep.be/blog/2005/06/30#arrived">p2, Wouter and Holger (green hair!) already nearby</a>; makes it only an anxious feeling to leave. Also, I called today <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwolf.org">Gunnar</a>,
since he was supposed to give me some shirts to carry to Helsinki (but
he won&#8217;t carry too many shirts, so he doesn&#8217;t need my back (still
hurts) anymore); he is leaving tomorrow (big fat lucky bastard :-*).<br/><br/>
Things at my house are just shit. We live in a shitty place (my mother
was just pushed and threatened outside the house, while taking her car
of the garage, by a Mr. Nobody, because of some issue with my father,
who works as a freelance lawyer). Is this normal? Are we supposed to
live with fear of being attacked? Even worst, is it normal for me to
see my mother go out for work and fear she (or my sister) get
kidnapped? Is this the &#8220;safer place&#8221; our major is talking about almost
everyday? Is this the &#8220;different government&#8221; that president Vicente Fox
says it is (since five years ago)? Is it so fucking normal to see my
mother, who is almost 50, go out for work everyday, and return 8 hours
later tired? All this is shit. Really. I&#8217;ll leave as soon as I can.<br/><br/>
And in the work the things are not better. I just can&#8217;t take my boss
who does not give me any work to do in the last two weeks. Some people
could think that that rocks, but not for me. Am I doing something
wrong? Am I going to be fired soon? Why is everybody nuts because of
the work load and not me? I was not allowed to go to Brazil (<a target="_blank" href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org">FISL</a>)
one month ago, because I was at Castell√≥n two months ago, and I&#8217;m going
to be at Finland next week, but, all of that is normal? I feel
sometimes tied to this company (which yes, they have gave much to me,
at least). I&#8217;m working because I need the money for the university, but
what if I lose my job? I&#8217;m going to be a 20/21 years old guy without
job, without school and completely frustrated.<br/><br/>
It is probably summer vacations also. I mean, in the school side. Or
the uncertainty of everything. I just have to leave soon (only 5 days
left) or I&#8217;ll jump from this building (six floors).<br/><br/>
Getting back from Finland, I&#8217;ll just wait a couple of weeks to return
to school, that&#8217;ll help. Hopefully. And then, I&#8217;ll start saving for my
next trip: <a target="_self" href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/">Germany 2006</a>. <br/><br/>
Thinking in the future makes life a little less worst.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
