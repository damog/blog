<p>These are my ten wishes for 2007. Since Santa didn&#8217;t arrive in this part of the world, I think I&#8217;m asking this to the Three Wise Men (in spite of they were brought here by the Spanish catolicism, but hey):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Dignity, land and respect to the Mexican indigenous groups.</li>
<li>Return and good health for Commander in Chief, Fidel Castro.</li>
<li>Strongest antineoliberalism in the Latin American region.</li>
<li>Right wing oppression brought down in Bolivia.</li>
<li>Good year socially, economically and politically to Nicaragua with its new hope.</li>
<li>An even better year in Cuban trades; they were the best growing economy in Latin America by exporting to South America and China.</li>
<li>Stop to the free trade agreement and military bases with the US in Ecuador.</li>
<li>Peaceful solution to the Colombia-Ecuador border conflict.</li>
<li>Democracy established in some of those countries where it&#8217;s more needed, like Central America.</li>
<li>More social successful programs in Venezuela.</li>
</ol>
<p>
And my bonus one:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Peace from Río Grande all the way down to Tierra del Fuego.</li>
</ul>
