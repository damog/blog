Recently, my <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bff">BFF</a> <a href="http://www.wadita.com">Wadita</a> (here <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raquelydavid/2556726909/">watching the horizon</a>) moved to Vancouver, BC from Mexico City to continue his studies on 3D animation. In the last months he was producing a short film for his personal portfolio which was finally released: it's called <strong>The Last Day</strong>. Even though (as he described it himself) it's not <em>Pixar</em>-like animation, I really enjoyed it, it's both melancholic and inspiring.

You can go to the <a href="http://www.wadita.com/thelastday/index.html" target="_blank">film website</a> and watch it on high and low quality with a bunch of neat resources. It's two minutes long. Go and enjoy it now!

Congratulations, Wada ;)
