I have started planning (and saving) a trip through Central America.<br/><br/>
I&#8217;d be flying to Panama City. Then San Jos√©, Managua, Tegucigalpa and
Guatemala. And then back to Mexico City. The only country I would not
visit in Central America because it is out of the route is Belize.<br/><br/>
I&#8217;m getting excited because of this. I hope somebody would like to join me. I hate being alone when traveling.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
