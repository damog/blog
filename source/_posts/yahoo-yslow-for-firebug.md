YSlow</a></strong>. It is a really nice piece of software, it adds a tab on your Firebug window and will grade the performance of the web page you are browsing with a set of tips on how to make it faster, ranging from images, CSS, JavaScript, headers, etc:

<p style="text-align: left;">I find this to not be the ultimate solution to fix your websites' loading speed of course, but something advisable to use and try to comply against.</p>
