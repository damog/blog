<p>Well, today we are 10 days away from flying to Brazil. We? <a href="http://www.gwolf.cx/">Gunnar</a> and me are going down there to Porto Alegre, where we&#8217;ll meet some other Debian enthusiasts and spend some time working for the project. The <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf4">DebConf4</a> mailing list seems pretty interesting right now.</p>

<p>One thing that made me laugh is Gunnar carrying his Sparc Classic and probably an Indy workstation: I would really prefer to have some clothes, instead of carrying a damn heavy computer :-P We&#8217;ll be there around 15 days (for DebConf4 and <a href="http://www.softwarelivre.org/forum2004/">5FISL</a>), and at least I&#8217;ll need a couple of things: Enough clothes and money :-P</p>

<p>Anyway, I just can&#8217;t wait &#8216;till DebConf: It&#8217;s been a nice plan since February, and it&#8217;s finally arriving time.</p>

<p>Besides DebConf I will take that half-month to work a little more on linevents (this a project I have worked on, and the only guys who know about is <a href="http://www.pitakill.net/">pitakill</a> and <a href="http://www.alobbs.com/">alo</a>), phile, my <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/from:damog@damog.net">Debian ITP&#8217;s</a> and some other stuff.</p>

<p>Cheers :)</p>
