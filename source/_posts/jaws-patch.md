<p>Well, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.jordi.net/">Jordi</a> and I started hacking today on Planet. He gave me some moral support while coding on Python, language that I really do not know perfectly.</p>

<p>He worked on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://jaws-project.sf.net/">JAWS</a> code, to see why they reported  as 00 hours on their RSS feeds.</p>

<p>So, here is the important thing: <strong>If you are using JAWS, and are syndicated on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.planetalinux.com.mx/">PlanetaLinux</a>, you probably should see that sometimes your feed is not well synchronized, that is because of that bug</strong>.</p>

<p>You should visit Jordiâ€™s website in order to apply the patch, it is just replacing a line.</p>
