<p>Yesterday, Friday, I made a test at the university about Calculus and Trigonometry. That test was like an introducing exam at the beginning of the semester to rate our levels of mathematics understanding. So we went to a computer lab to make the exam. The program, called <a href="http://www.aleks.com/">Aleks</a> is an extremely powerful computer mathematic system, not only for making exams, but for learning mathematics. It runs embedded on a browser, running some kind of Java applets, which is sad.

Anyway, I have a JVM from Sun installed on my system (in my last job I needed to have that crap installed), so the Java applets are usually well displayed on the browser. So, I thought I could enter to Aleks system in my laptop, which does not use Windows+IExplorer, like the computing lab from the university where we made the exam.

So, I tried to access, and tried to run the install:

That leaves me some encountered feelings:
</p>
<li>It is totally insane that the software, running on a browser, does not run cleanly, on my Mozilla Firefox.</li>
<li>It is totally insane that those guys, from Aleks, which is a scientific program, for mathematics, could make it «supported» for Linux.</li>
<li>Anyway, they give a solution for that problem.

So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what to think :-| That is the problem ever and ever. Should I blame the guys from Aleks? Should I blame the guys from the Mathematics department from university for choosing that? Or my teachers from Electronic Engineering for doing what the last guys told them to do? The university&#8217;s principal?

Anyway, Aleks is nice. It has plenty things to work with, it has excellent programs for graphics, functions, etc.</li>
