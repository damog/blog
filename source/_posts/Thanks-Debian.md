Hi,

Ten years ago today (2005-08-14) my account was created:

https://nm.debian.org/public/person/damog

Today, I don't feel like Debian represents me and neither do I represent the
project anymore.

I had tried over the last couple of years to retake my involvement but lack of
motivation and time always got on the way, so the right thing to do for me is
to officially retire and gtfo.

I certainly learned a bunch from dozens of Debian people over these many years,
and I'm nothing but grateful with all of them; I will for sure carry the project
close to my heart — as I carry it with the Debian swirl I still have tattooed
on my back ;)

I have three packages left that have not been updated in forever and you can
consider orphaned now: gcolor2, libperl6-say-perl and libxml-treepp-perl.

With all best wishes,
David Moreno.

I received a couple of questions about my decision here. I basically don't feel like Debian represents my interests and neither do I represent the project – this doesn't mean I don't _believe_ in free software, to the contrary. I think some of the best software advancements we've made as society are thanks to it. I don't necessarily believe on how the project has evolved itself, whether that has been the right way, to regain relevancy and dominance, and if it's remained primarily a way to feed dogmatism versus pragmatism. [This](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/11/msg00174.html) is the perfect example of a tragic consequence. I was very happy to learn that the current Debian Conference being held in Germany got the highest attendance ever, hopefully that can be utilized in a significant and useful way.

Regardless, my contributions to Debian were never noteworthy so it's also not that big of a deal. I just need to close cycles myself and move forward, and the ten year anniversary looked like a significant mark for that.

Poke [me](http://twitter.com/habanerd) in case you wanna discuss some more. I'll always be happy to. Specially over beer :)

Peace.
