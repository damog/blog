<p>I have received a couple of questions regarding of my use of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> instead of any other weblog system. It&#8217;s quite easy.

LiveJournal is a free software company, using free software to build a business. That&#8217;s widely cool, they are not the same kind of company that allows you to store a webservice and then gets yourself deep on spam. That&#8217;s ethic.

But, why am I using LiveJournal web service instead of <a href="http://jaws.com.mx/">jaws</a>, *Nuke or other web logs? Because I&#8217;m lazy to maintain a web site for my own. That&#8217;s well shown on damog.net cover page ;-)

I installed jaws some days ago, <a href="http://www.damog.net/blog">here</a>. I like it, but not too much, I really prefer to have something that I like the most, not just use because it was developed in Mexico, or by some friends: That&#8217;s the truth. I don&#8217;t like it to be so related to some stuff that nobody cares, but the developers (MVC, ERP, SOAP, etc, etc, etc&#8230;). It&#8217;s obviously a personal opinion.

Some weeks ago, I installed also <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo</a> to use it more like a organization framework, <a href="http://mambo.damog.net/">here</a>. It is extremely beautiful, those guys from graphic design rock, exploding lots of great features of JavaScript and web development.

Any way, I just changed the layout of my LiveJournal&#8217;s weblog. I like it, as I did with <a href="http://www.live365.com/">Live365</a>, I would probably buy a paid account, to support a little bit. What they say in their Paid Accounts page is a thought I really share:
</p>
<pre>Do I have to pay for using LiveJournal services?
No, of course not. Paying for web services is annoying, we agree.
That's why nearly all of LiveJournal's functionality is available
free of charge. However, if you're happy with the service you're
being provided, show your support and get a paid account.</pre>

So, why not? At least, at the end of month, when I receive my check from work ;-)
