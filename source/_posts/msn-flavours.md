<p>So, if you were a candy or dessert, what would you be?

I&#8217;ve been playing a little bit with some stupid nicknames on the MSN&#8230;

What could happen if I were a <a href="mailto:damog@damog.net">damog</a>of hot chocolate, or white chocolate, or cookies and cream chocolate? Maybe a strawberry jam damog. Probably I would prefer to be a sweet rice and milk candy damog, or a marshmallow one. ;) Who know? What would you like to be? Would you prefer to be some salty thing? :-P

Anyway, if you want to add me to your MSN contact list, do it with the contact: damog@damog.net&#8230; I was tired with the old @hotmail.com account that used to confused people with my primary mail.

My mother just gave me a soft little toy dog, with a very nice face very similar to mine, here is a pic, just next to my laptop:

Smoothie :) I gave him the name of: Sarge Dog Jr. ;-)
