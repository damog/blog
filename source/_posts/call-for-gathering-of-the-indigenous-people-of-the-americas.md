<p>Transcript of the call for participation on the  <a href="http://www.encuentroindigena.org/" target="_blank">Gathering of the Indigenous People of the Americas</a>. If you don’t mind, feel free to skip it.

Considering that 515 years after the first invasion of our ancestral territories, the war of conquest, the plunder, and capitalist exploitation have not altered their course, but rather have become a new war of extermination, a war designed for the destruction and utter plunder of all the original peoples of the Americas;

Considering that the long history of wars of independence and numerous revolutions that have taken place on our continent have not yet changed the condition of colonized people, nor have they allowed for a full recognition of our rights in the nation states that formed in the last two centuries;

Considering that despite a long history of domination, our resistance has sustained itself and that our people continue to live and struggle, and that this struggle has been encouraged by the uprising of the Zapatista National Liberation Front (EZLN) in the first days of 1994;

Considering that the strategies of the national governments of the Americas have always sought the division of our people through the establishment of borders, reservations, and legislation designed to fragment us and to neutralize our efforts of autonomy;

Considering that the strengthening and the unity of the struggles of liberation of the indigenous people of the Americas will be possible as our peoples meet and come to know each other;

Considering that for our people it has proven necessary that their struggles be made known world wide in order to be supported by all honest movements that struggle for a society effectively just, free, and democratic;

All indigenous communities, tribes, and nations of the Americas are called to
