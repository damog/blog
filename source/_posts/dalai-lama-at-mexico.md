He will be here mainly because, <a href="http://www.uia.mx/">the University</a> will give him an Honoris Causa doctorate. That&#8217;s greatly unbelievable, to have it here, in the college, next October 7th, I bet this will be madness, I hope I could get into the main auditorium that day.

The sad part is China has warned Mexican government to not allow him to give any political speech, nor leave him with a government surface. What does this mean? China does not want Latino America to know what The Dalai Lama have to say for Tibet freedom. China is worried about him going out to several countries speaking about Chinese repression.

Kong Quan, Chinese exterior relationships speaker said that The Dalai Lama is in a <em>political exile whom does separatists activities against their mother country</em>. Pretty hard to understand, right? That is sad, a Peace Nobel Price, being accused of trying to destroy China. I really don&#8217;t think so. This speaks very bad of Chinese government.

Anyway, just to know a little bit more of Dalai Lama, he was born in 1930&#8217;s, ran out to exile in 1959, after a failed civil revolution against Chinese fascism, since then he lives in the north of India, instead of Tibet, although he is the religious and spiritual leader nowadays of Buddhism, a sacred descendant Siddharta Gautama, of Tibetan community.
