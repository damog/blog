I&#8217;ve enjoyed reading Richard Gott&#8217; article named <strong>Latin America is preparing to settle accounts with its white settler elite</strong>, where he goes deeply on how the recent political movements in the region has been marked more on lineage and classism than in anything else. Read the article in English <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zmag.org/content/print_article.cfm?itemID=11439&amp;sectionID=20">here</a>, or in Spanish, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=42703">here</a> (thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rebelion.org">Rebeli√≥n</a>).
