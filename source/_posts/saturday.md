<p>Last Saturday, <a href="http://raquelhernandez.net/" target="_blank">we</a> attended a party at <a href="http://vireo.org/~stew/blog" target="_blank">stew</a> and rcox&#8217; place in Brooklyn. <a href="http://www.healthhacker.org/satoroams/" target="_blank">Biella</a>, Micah, <a href="http://xana.scru.org/" target="_blank">Clint</a> and a bunch of other people were also there. It was very nice and we had a lot of fun. I had the chance to tell Clint that some of his blog postings really intrigue me; I now feel relieved. Besides, I&#8217;ve learned that boxing against Micah on the Wii is so tiring that even days after, my arms and back still hurt :-( We left at around 1:45 am.<br/>
On our way back to Harlem, we stopped to have some tacos at El √çdolo on the 8th Ave and the 14th St, as <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/kevin.mark/" target="_blank">Kevin</a> suggested me before; for our surprise, they were amazing and have been so far, the best Mexican food we&#8217;ve had in NYC :-)</p>

<p>So, after getting off on the 145th station and walked nine blocks, we arrived to our warm place at 4:30 am.</p>
