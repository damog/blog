Well, <a href="http://www.kublun.com/">Wieland</a> and me have created <a href="http://www.planetalinux.com.mx/">PlanetaLinux</a> which is a small planet feed reeder for Mexican Linux users. It is intended to grow as soon as we announce it officially.

I’ve worked on the art/configuration, we still have some problems because the five people now suscribed to the planet use <a href="http://jaws.com.mx/">jaws</a> which have a little encoding problem.

Feedback is very welcome.
