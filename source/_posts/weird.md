<p>It&#8217;s extremely weird when sometimes happen what some friends and I lived yesterday. Let me tell you:</p>

<p>We (some friends and I) had a couple of parties to go to. The first one was with my good friend <a href="http://zilus.evolucionlinux.com/">Zilus</a>, on a zone called Tecamachalco (which is a little far away from my home, but closer to university). He said pretty ladies were going to be there, as well as good music and environment. So, I decided to go. But before going to pick up my girl, I called Chema (another friend) to see if he had something else. He did.</p>

<p>- Chema: &#8220;Yeah, <em>Promis</em> has a party on Pedregal, one of his friends from work (he, Promis, works on a Starbucks Coffee Station).<br/>
- damog: I have a party on Tecamachalco.<br/>
- Chema: So, it&#8217;s up to you.<br/>
- damog: OK, yeah, I think I prefer to go with you guys, so I&#8217;ll go pick up Raquel and then I&#8217;m on your home.</p>

<p>So, I picked her up, and went to Chema&#8217;s apartment. Promis lives on the same building than Chema, so they were waiting for us (Raq and I) already. So I called them by ringing my car&#8217;s horn. In the meantime, I was talking with Raq:</p>

<p>- damog: I think I don&#8217;t want to go with my car today, what do you think if I leave my car at my house, and hop in the Promis&#8217; car.<br/>
- Raq: Yeah, sounds good to me.</p>

<p>The only problem there was to schedule the return way. So, I asked by phone another friend (Joss) if he could bring us back (Raq and I live very close each other). He accepted. We left my car on my car and went to meet some other friends at Huevo&#8217;s house (Huevo is, of course, his nickname).</p>

<p>At Huevo&#8217;s it was Frijol and Jericó, some other friends. So we were waiting to some other guys and friends, as long as I can remember: Muñeco, Marcial, Barney, Trompiate, Karla and other 5 guys, which I don&#8217;t know very well, I think.</p>

<p>After that, some other friends of friends invited more friends to come to the party. At a certain moment, we arrived, finally, to the house were the party was going to be held, around midnight. We were, surprisingly, around 20 people! I remember Orkut with that: Friends inviting friends to get involved. It was awesome how that can be conformed.</p>

<p>Anyway, all of us were following Promis, which was the contact there. But the things began to become worst: It was not a party, which all of us really thought (we were carrying some bottles of rum, tequila and beer). It was like a very close meeting! And the worst part: A very rude sir opened the door and saw us with a horrible and anger face asking what were we doing there. Promis said we came with Yaqui (apparently, his daughter) to the party.</p>

<p>The father closed the door and went to talk with the girl. After a couple of minutes, she opened the door and let us get in. The house was enormous, with a long yard and even a swimming pool (it is not very common to have a swimming pool in Mexico City) and a bunch of young, bastard and stupid snobs in the yard.</p>

<p>So, we tried to just ignore the fact that most of us were not on the right place, with not the right people and began to drink a little bit, joking around. I have to say that the father was on a balcony watching us every time.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes, more people, around 10 or 15 (our friends of friends) arrived! So we were like 30 or 35 guys, with like a social network!</p>

<p>And finally the moment everyone was thinking it was going to occur, the father told the daughter to tell us to leave. So, we left the house, like if we were like a bunch of criminals. I bet we all are more easy going than the other rich bastards. Besides, we heard that the father was some kind of cop. Corrupt and stupid cop.</p>

<p>Anyway, we went to some other party, in a zone called <em>Las Águilas</em>, which is a zone more familiar, not so snob. But they didn&#8217;t let us get in, because the party was dying already (it was around 1:30 am). So we decided to go Frijol&#8217;s apartment: Around 25 guys.</p>

<p>And we finally died there: Drinking, smoking and having good time with good friends.</p>

<p>The weird thing is the fact that we could get a party and they threw us like trash to the streets :-( Not once: Twice.</p>

<p>Hell.</p>
