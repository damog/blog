<p>Finally today was our Debian Control Center meeting. I was pretty cool, I was happy to see the channel full of people, although not every one was in the active talk.</p>

<p>The log can be reached <a href="http://www.damog.net/debian/debian-control-center.log">here</a>.</p>

<p>Seems like we have to start really working.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m giving a course with <a href="http://tacvbo.net/">Ta^3</a> and <a href="http://p4ola.jaws.com.mx/">p4ola</a> of Linux, it is a long course of 80 hours, I&#8217;m giving the three first days (24 hours) on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, after that I hope I could go to some vacation days next weekend, hopefully to Acapulco, but if I am lucky (which means money), I would love to go to Cuba, but I see it a little bit difficult, probably Cancun would be a better and cheaper choice.</p>
