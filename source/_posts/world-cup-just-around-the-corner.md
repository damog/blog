<p>Well, Mexico played three preparation games in Europe on their way to start the World Cup. They played against France and the Netherlands on their territories and well, I think Mexico was not ready enough, it is not solid and the manager was making lots of crazy movements. They ended 1-0 and 2-1, respectively. Obviously those were difficult matches against f√∫tbol potences on their home, but still Mexico has plenty of capacity to beat any of those countries.</p>

<p>The third game was against a German university, Gottingen, which was more a diplomatic match (the manager and players didn&#8217;t want to play it, but it was because of the chief managers of Mexico, trying to make a good relationship with the city and/or Germany, itself). We won 0-3.</p>

<p>Next week, on Friday, the World Cup will begin. The Mexican team will be playing firstly, against Iran, then Angola and finally Portugal, on group D. I don&#8217;t see Mexico solid and trustable enough yet, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes against Iran, which have been playing widely good (they won Costa Rica 3-2, back in March; drew 2-2 with Croatia and won 5-2 against Bosnia-Herzegovina; these last two in the last couple of days). Iran is not at all, an easy enemy.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see how it goes. I&#8217;ll be reporting more World Cup news on the next weeks :)</p>
