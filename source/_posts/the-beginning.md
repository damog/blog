<p>I don&#8217;t like Mondays, whatever I do, I do it tired. This is maybe a normal behaviour on the world.</p>

<p>Maybe I am like a cool mutant that only works fine on not mondays ;) Walkin through the walls and then, on monday, just sleep and do nothing ;)</p>

<p>It is nice, maybe one day I will make like a brebage that makes do that.</p>

<p>SOAD is the only thing that seems nice today.</p>
