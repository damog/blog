<p>So, I have finally moved my blog to MovableType from Wordpress and a couple of interesting things have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve gave birth to my new blog, <a href="http://infinitepig.damog.net/">Infinite Pig Theorem</a>.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve started <a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Edamog/Blog-Normalize-0.0rc1/">Blog::Normalize</a> as an entirely <i>i-don&#8217;t-give-too-much-shit-if-people-disagree-so-beat-it-dude</i> project. You can import posts to MovableType from Wordpress as the time of writing which was my whole purpose at first, but then expanded the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels good to be back.</p>
