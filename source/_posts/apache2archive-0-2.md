<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache2-Archive">Apache2::Archive</a> is a mod_perl 2 extension that allows the Apache HTTP server to expose tar and tar.gz archives on the fly. When a client requests such an archive file, the server will return a page displaying information about the file that allows the user to view or download individual files from within the archive.

I just uploaded version <strong>0.2</strong> to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~damog">CPAN</a> and <a href="http://github.com/damog/apache2-archive/tree/0.2">GitHub</a> correcting a few automatic build issues presented with dependencies. Grab it now with <tt><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-CPAN-Fresh/">cpanf</a></tt>!
