	<li>We took a chance and traveled to Boston during the weekend. We met there with <a href="http://blog.carrion.ws/">Mario Carri√≥n</a>, <a href="http://mechulk.com/">Mauro Parra</a> and some other friends. It is a beautiful city, we walked on Boston Commons, Newbury St and got up to the Prudential Building, it was a quick visit. We also wandered around the MIT. Boston has the kind of charming touch you (or at least I) cannot find in New York City anymore. Fifteen bucks for each ride on the Fung Wah Bus (a Chinatown one), it was nicely cheap but utterly awful.</li>
	<li>Even though this was Memorial Day weekend, we stayed most of the Monday at our place. It was nice to have a day off.</li>
	<li>I'm traveling to Mexico City again this next weekend to attend the wedding of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raquelydavid/2522748226/">Christian and Susan</a> in Cuernavaca, who were in NYC two weeks ago. Depart on Friday, back on Sunday (all hungover, I bet).</li>
	<li>My Infinite Pig Theorem blog is back and live again. And lots and lots of pics on <a href="http://fotos.raquelydavid.net/">Flickr</a>, go watch 'em now, go!</li>
