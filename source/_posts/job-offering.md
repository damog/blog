A friend of mine is asking me to publish his company's job offering to the wild. I've seen the offer, what they are doing and it's a very, very nice project/opportunity, I wouldn't announce it here on my blog if it wasn't something worthwhile:
<blockquote><a href="http://lytix.com">Lytix</a> is seeking an experienced software developer with proven ability
to produce, understand and critique code in C, Java and JavaScript;
Perl and LISP are a plus.  He or she should have broad experience
working with heterogeneous environments and multiple platforms,
including BSD Unix/Linux, LAMP and other relevant F/OSS platforms.
Work will initially be project-based, but could evolve quickly into a
full-time position.  The candidate will be based in Mexico City.</blockquote>
I'd also add: fluent English, both written and spoken is a must. If you are interested, please drop him a line, <a href="mailto:diego.villarreal@lytix.com">Diego Villarreal</a>, and avoid putting me in between. :)
