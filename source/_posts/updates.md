	<li>Personal stuff coming up; if you are not <em>that</em> kind of person, please skip :-)</li>
	<li>I forgot to say on my <a href="http://log.damog.net/2008/06/yapcna-2008.html">previous post about YAPC::NA 2008</a> that while I was in Chicago, I had the really nice chance to meet Carlo Segre and Dirk Eddelbuettel and enjoy a couple of nice beers with them. Great guys!</li>
	<li>I'm probably not attending <a href="http://debconf8.debconf.org/">DebConf</a> this year. It's just too expensive right now and since sponsorship appears to be not enough, chances for me are quite low now. The cheapest I can get from NYC is around $1050/1100, which might be cheap for some folks in Europe which paid the same amount in Euros, but not for me now.</li>
	<li>I'm not attending OSCON neither. I wanted to, I really did, but it'll have to be next year now, because...</li>
	<li>On that days, I'll be in Mexico City with <a href="http://maggit.com.mx/">Raquel</a> renewing our visas. Almost one year already since we got here, time flies.</li>
	<li>Last Friday (Fourth of July), we were invited by <a href="http://vireo.org/">Mike and Rachel O'Connor</a> to a barbeque at their place in Brooklyn. Even though they are veggies, they had some meat sausages and burgers which were great (also the grilled corn!). We watched the fireworks from their roof, which I have to say, weren't as spectacular as I expected, but it was probably because we weren't very, very close to Manhattan or because a big building was blocking our view in front of us, or because of the rain. A bunch of their friends were also there. I enjoyed spending time with them and <a href="http://riseup.net/">Mr. Micah Anderson</a> and <a href="http://teporocho.net/">Sr. Abraham Estrada</a>. By the way...</li>
	<li>There will be a Debian NYC BSP very soon now! Stay tuned! Represent! :P</li>
	<li>I've been playing more chess that it should be legal, as some of you may have already realized.</li>
	<li>I gave myself a present and bought a PSP. I now do alley-oops, slam dunks and all kind of dribbles on NBA Live 2008 on my morning commute ;-)</li>
	<li>And last; for my personal workstation, I'm trying now Ubuntu Hardy and I'm doing a personal project with Rails. I have to say that even though I had some encountered feelings about both of them, I've been having quite a nice surprise and experience with both.</li>
