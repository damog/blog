<p>It&#8217;s incredible how one troll can split a channel up. It&#8217;s incredible how the sexist shit can be spread all over the place. It&#8217;s incredible, not wait, not incredible, it&#8217;s sad, sadder and sadder, to see what Debian has become. The Debian social life has become a center for dramas of all kinds, since sexist traumas, transgenders issues, people with too much free time, real good technical people leaving, freaking big farts in Debian thinking on leaving the project, elitist dolls clubs, small wannabes who think they can treat other people unrespectful. Debian itself is now its own slow killer. There has always been old people, new people, people leaving and people entering, but when you see other projects just as good as we were, some of us remain because of the social side of Debian. But is it really worthwhile? Perhaps not anymore.

And because of the non-sense shit from the debian-women mailing list thread, here are a few random greps on my old logs:

<blockquote> Jun 11&#160;07:19:29 &lt;directhex|work&gt;        timgoh0, for the same reason a woman in skimpy lingerie is sexier than a women in the nude, lesbians are sexier to watch than a threesome. it&#8217;s the *potential* being presented. the thinly veiled chance for the imagination to run wild

Sep 13&#160;00:23:27 &lt;tech&gt;  women are mostly useless

Sep 12&#160;23:28:10 &lt;tech&gt;  nvz: just stay away from women, it&#8217;s easier

Mar 04&#160;20:12:32 &lt;nvz&gt;   women like to be refluffled

Jan 13&#160;12:50:07 &lt;toresbe&gt;       rcox: Some idiot got out on the debian-women mailing list and said #debian-offtopic was &#8220;sexist&#8221;.</blockquote>
<p>
Of course we are sexists, just like we are men and women unfriendly, we laugh about nationalities, we like fluffling, make fun of others and we like to be nipple smited. Love it or get the fuck out of there.

We&#8217;re an unofficial community now. Who would want to be official after all? </p>
