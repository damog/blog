<strong>Main Topic: Perrin Harkins: "Choosing a Web Architecture for Perl"</strong>

Perl Seminar NY is once again pleased to welcome Apache expert and veteran Open Source contributor Perrin Harkins to speak at our meeting.

In the past few years, many new web proxy servers have come onto the scene with new performance promises and features. Servers based on non-blocking I/O bring claims of greatly improved performance. At the same time, FastCGI has become more widely used, giving people a possible alternative to mod_perl. Perrin's talk will help you choose the right architecture for your project by presenting a useful set of benchmarks and a comparison of strong points and key features.

Hope to see you on Tuesday November 17.
