After a random series of hazardous events, I'm finally at <a href="http://debconf9.debconf.org">DebConf 9</a> in CÃ¡ceres, Spain. I'll post more updates later, right now I'm trying to put my sh*t together and find my way through around here for the next couple of weeks. Interested people can always <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=FOLLOW+damog">follow</a> my <a href="http://twitter.com/amsterdamog">microblogging feed</a> too.

Love, <em>D</em>.
