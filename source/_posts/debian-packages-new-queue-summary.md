<p>As it was already showed on debian-devel mailing list, Miriam Ruiz, Anibal Monsalve and me have been working on a new face for the <a href="http://qa.debian.org/~anibal/debian-NEW.html">NEW queue summary</a>.</p>
<p>Every comment on the discussion has been appreciated and discussed, we are working hard on them :-)</p>
