title: "Ruby goodies: Modules and methods for my everyday Ruby"

I make a lot of Web script processing, whether scraping, webservices, systems administration, etc. Because I sometimes happen to repeat small and useful chunks of code for different projects, I thought that, given making new modules and methods is usually hassleless in Ruby, I should make my own set of methods and goodies I constantly use. Example 1, I sometimes miss Perl's LWP::Simple simplicity where I just pass a URL to a subroutine and get the content on a variable, quick, one-liner. Example 2, extract all links on a given URL on an array that I can then iterate and maybe fetch given the first example. Getting all A links is very easy to do, say with regex or with Hpricot (which should the best way to parse HTML), but most of the time I (and people, I'd bet) need absolute URLs which is fairly more complex (relative, absolute URLs, BASE href declarations, etc, the same case as in <a href="http://axiombox.com/feedbag">Feedbag</a>).

Well, for different cases like that one, I've started my own set of Ruby goodies. If you don't find them useful, I understand, they are mostly for my <strongown</strong> needs, I just want to make it public, because maybe, some other people might indeed find them useful.

Simple installation:
<pre><code>sudo gem install damog-goodies -s http://gems.github.com/</code></pre>

As time and needs pass, I will be adding stuff into it. For the time being, here's both above examples in action:

<pre><code>
>> require "goodies"
requiring /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/damog-goodies-0.1/lib/goodies/array.rb
requiring /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/damog-goodies-0.1/lib/goodies/lwr.rb
requiring /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/damog-goodies-0.1/lib/goodies/html.rb
