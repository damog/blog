There's a lot of very interesting <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/program/" target="_blank">talks</a> and <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/speakers/" target="_blank">people</a> speaking at the conference, so it was basically a no-brainer since it's being held in Manhattan. Plus, <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> is one of the platforms I've always liked and admired on how they have achieved to become a mainstream product with a huge amount of active users and developers. I started using it way back in 2004 when it was b2/cafelog, so it's been a long ride.
