I just posted a gig-based <a href="http://jobs.perl.org/job/10998">job offering</a> on<a href="http://jobs.perl.org/"> jobs.perl.org</a>:

<strong>Description</strong>

I'm looking for a developer with interest in Web data harvesting and scraping. I'm currently developing a number of projects with this model and I cannot continue doing them alone. You will be a vital part of these fun projects: I usually enjoy doing them, you should be into that too :)

You can be anywhere in the world, I don't care as long as results are shown.

I'm looking for a long-term partner for this, not a hit &amp; run.

<strong>Required skills</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I need you to understand intermediate Perl, OO-design and medium to complex implementations.</li>
	<li>You need to have a working skillset of regular expressions.</li>
	<li>Knowledge and understanding of HTTP basics is vital too. I use an HTTP sniffer + Firebug most of the time.</li>
	<li>A UNIX (Linux or MacOS) background would be a plus.</li>
	<li>Git is an extra plus. If you are into Subversion, you'd be willing to convert to Git</li>
</ul>
<strong>Desired skills</strong>

Perl modules mostly used: WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent (good understanding of it, to extend Mech), HTML::TreeBuilder, HTML::Parser (and its descents), CGI::Fast, Modern::Perl, Moose (beginning to move most of our codebase to real OO), Module::Install, Module::Pluggable and sometimes cool stuff like Catalyst, HTTP::Engine and mod_perl 2.

If you are interested, or know someone that might be, please let me know.
