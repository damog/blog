<p>Being this a culture of consumption and me being a weak creature of nature, I just got a brand new Gold Suscription  on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.comics.com/">Comics.com</a> home of the awarded <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.dilbert.com/">dilbert</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.snoopy.com/">snoopy</a>, but besides, there are plenty of great new artists waiting for us to watch, at least their work.</p>

<p>If you like amateur comics (everything but dilbert and peanuts in comics.com is amateur), you will probably love to give a try at comics.com. I used to have a free account receiving one strip from Monday to Saturday on my email (with the suscription I’m receiving now up to 70 strips <img alt="tongue.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/tongue.png"/> and other small advantages).</p>

<p>Some of the best, IMO, are <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.comics.com/comics/shirleynson/">Shirley and Son</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.comics.com/wash/pcnpixel/">PC and Pixel</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.comics.com/comics/bornloser/">The Born Loser</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.comics.com/creators/zack/">Zack Hill</a>, although I have not checked all the titles on the archive.</p>
