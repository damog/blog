Hey <a href="http://michael.stapelberg.de/">Michael Stapelberg</a>, thanks for
creating <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3</a> and making me believe again that
people have a clue and things can be done just right (specially when it comes
to something easily done crappy like window managers). Thanks for just getting
it all right, and not only from the software point of view, but also for the
community, the style around it, etc. Kudos.
