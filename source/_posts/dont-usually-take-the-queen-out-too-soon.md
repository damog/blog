And this is the perfect example. While I had a wonderful position, my opponent failed by trying to checkmate me too soon, and it took me some time to figure out a way to mate him myself. I consider a bit disrespectful to take the queen out too soon. See the game <a href="http://www.chess.com/echess/game.html?id=7742631">here</a>. No more PGNs for you.
