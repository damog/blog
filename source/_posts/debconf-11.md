<img class="alignleft" style="margin: 20px;" title="No DebConf" src="http://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/no-debconf11.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Last year, I had all the intention in the world to go to Bosnia and Herzegovina this summer to attend <a href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/">DebConf 11</a>, but given my non-existent involvement on the project for the last couple of years, there's no reason for me to do it. Even last year when the event was held in town, I was not entirely thrilled about it. Life has changed quite a bit in the last few years, allowing me to just find and allocate my priorities on their right places.

I hope everybody attending have a great time and snap lots of photos for me to see and regret not being there.
