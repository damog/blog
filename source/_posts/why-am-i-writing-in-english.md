<p>I have received several comments on why am I writing my blog in English, since many of the Mexican guys involved on free software who own a blog and use to blog periodicly, don’t. Obviously I had to talk about this some time because it is not usual.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>i18n</strong>. Do you really do not understand English? Or probably <em>my</em> English? If you do, who cares?</li>
<li>
<strong>Reach</strong>. It is widely know English reaches more people than only a few people. I have the crazy idea that some, at least one, non Spanish speaker, would read my blog.</li>
<li>
<strong>I can</strong>. I write in English because I can. WYSIWYG. <img alt="smile.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/smile.png"/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Anonymous.</strong> While I get anonymous posts about writing in English, I will keep on doing it. If you really can’t tell me things face to face, then I don’t give a shit about cowards.</li>
<li>
<strong>Why not?</strong> Why not write my blog entries in English?</li>
</ul>
