<blockquote>
<p align="left">CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 10 — President Hugo Chávez was sworn in to a new six-year term at a ceremony here on Wednesday in which he described Jesus as &#8220;the greatest socialist in history&#8221; and pledged to speed Venezuela’s metamorphosis into a Socialist country.

&#8220;Fatherland! Socialism or death, I swear it!&#8221; Mr. Chávez yelled as he was sworn in and given the presidential sash and a golden key to the tomb where the remains of Simón Bolívar, the South American liberator, are interred.</p>
