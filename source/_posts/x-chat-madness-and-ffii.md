<p>So, lately I&#8217;ve been over IRC spending lots of time.I started using <a href="http://xchat-gnome.navi.cx/">xchat-gnome</a> but it really seems to young, it doesn&#8217;t implement much features and crashes lots of times.

So, I continued using normal X-Chat, and the madness is all the channels I&#8217;m logged in anytime.

So, <a href="http://www.cyrius.com/">Martin Michlmayr</a>, the current <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/leader">Debian Project Leader</a>, sent an email for <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">debian-project</a> mailing list inviting to donate to <a href="http://www.ffii.org/">FFII</a>:
</p>
<pre>FFII supports the development of public
information goods based on copyright, free competition, and open
standards.  Some of their current activities are directed against
software patents in Europe, and given that software patents are
potentially a big risk for free software and Debian, I think this
effort should be supported us.  I see this donation only as a first
step and feel that Debian should actively speak out against software
patents.  I encourage members and users of Debian to get involved
with or donate to FFII and tell others about the dangers of software
patents.</pre>
<p>
Smooth. That is hugely interesting. If you are able, please support.
