A few days ago, McDonald published a cartoon on the end of the dictator Pinochet.

Yesterday, fascist dictator <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a> died in the Military Hospital in Santiago, after heart and lung diseases, being 91 years old. Now, current president <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet">Michelle Bachelet</a>, a moderate socialist, in case Pinochet is given State memorials, could be attending the ceremony (in a predominantly conservative country as Chile), even after she was tortured and persecuted under the dictatorship and his father was murdered under the regimen, after serving <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende">Salvador Allende</a>&#8217; government.

Shitty life, huh?

Viva Chile!, just as the ironman <a target="_blank" href="http://oskuro.net/blog/life/pinochet-2006-12-11-19-29">stated</a>. </p>
