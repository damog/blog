<p>Well, different things from now. I have some different things to blog that I don&#8217;t really know where to start.

<strong>School</strong>
It is refreshing sometime when you have plenty of things to do. A couple of projects, homework, studying, but specially when you really like your <a href="http://www.iec.uia.mx/ice.html">career</a>. Obviously this is my case now, although tons of things to do for the next week.

<strong>Work</strong>
Apparently next week will also be a very tired one: Giving some courses of <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle</a> to some teachers become a heavy and dying work. It is not the same administering the server than giving technical support.

<strong>Mozillion</strong>
I want to thank <a href="http://paul.luon.net/">Paul van Tilburg</a> for reading <a href="http://www.damog.net//">my blog</a>, as he said in his <a href="http://paul.luon.net/home/Journal">last journal&#8217;s entry</a> ;-) He is a nice guy from <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> project which I met in the <a href="http://pkg-ruby.alioth.debian.org/">Debian Ruby</a> packaging team. He is my <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint#Sponsor">sponsor</a> for the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/libgtk-trayicon-ruby">libgtk-trayicon-ruby</a> package, and hopefully also for <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=264281">libtermios-ruby</a> very soon :-)

<strong>Ultrasónicas at Multiforo Alicia</strong>
So, las <a href="http://www.ultrasonicas.cjb.net/">Ultrasónicas</a>, a very nice punk/rock/garage/surf girl band will convert noise into music next October 2nd at Multiforo Alicia (a very underground and tiny rock bar in the downtown of Mexico City). Here is the flyer:

So, I was very glad several people tried to solve the triangle problem in the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/damog/11239.html">last entry</a>. <a href="http://www.mathomatic/">George</a> and <a href="http://www.kublun.com/">Wieland</a> dare to give a result :-)

The answer is: <em>There is not answer</em>. ;-)

If the &#8220;inscribed&#8221; circle has a radius of 1, it has a diameter of 2, the same length as one of the &#8220;triangle&#8221; sides. If you try to draw a circle with a tangent segment equal to its diameter, there are two possibilities, either the point of tangency bisects the segment or it does not. If it does, two other &#8220;sides&#8221; tangent to the circle will be parallel and no triangle will be formed. If the point of tangency does not bisect the 2&#160;cm. line there is no way that a 4&#160;cm. line connected to either end can form a second side that can be joined by a third side. Impossible conditions unless I&#8217;m overlooking something!

Yes. Put another way, put the side of length 4 in a horizontal position on the x-axis. So either the left or right side of the triangle is length 2. This means the altitude of the triangle is less than 2. No way can you inscribe a circle whose diameter is greater than the triangle&#8217;s altitude.

:-D

<strong>GParted</strong>
I just got engaged with another package for <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>: <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">GParted</a>, which is a graphical front end for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html">GNU Parted</a>. Sven Luther, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/">libparted</a>&#8217;s maintainer accepted nicely to work together and sponsor it.

I think that&#8217;s all for the moment.
