Generalizations are fun, they always are because they tend to offend people and offended people by stupid shit is usually lots of fun.

Here <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>, as a whole, fails; it sucks. Here Debian <strong>blows ass</strong>, the entire project is whack.

My good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/account/profile_image/akachrislee?hreflang=en">Chris Lee</a> sent me this:

<iframe style="border:2px solid #000000" height="500" width="100%" src="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=380731" title="Debian fails"></iframe>

If you can't see the above iframe, go <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=380731">here</a>.

Debian, full of fail. Wasn't this generalization fun?

Let the non-sense bullshit horses be released.
