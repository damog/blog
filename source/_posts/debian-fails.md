Generalizations are fun, they always are because they tend to offend people and offended people by stupid shit is usually lots of fun.

Here [Debian](http://debian.org), as a whole, fails; it sucks. Here Debian **blows ass**, the entire project is whack.

My good friend [Chris Lee](https://twitter.com/akachrislee) sent me this:

<iframe style="border:2px solid #000000" height="500" width="100%" src="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=380731" title="Debian fails"></iframe>

If you can't see the above iframe, [here](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=380731).

Debian, full of fail. Wasn't this generalization fun?

Let the non-sense bullshit horses be released.
