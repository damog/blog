So, as <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/BSP2008/Brooklyn">it was previously anounced</a> (and recently re-invited by <a href="http://lists.vireo.org/pipermail/debiannyc/2008-September/000190.html">Micah</a>), this weekend is the <a href="http://vireo.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/debiannyc">debiannyc</a> BSP. This makes me think on my lack of involvement on the technical part of Debian (I'm still socially involved with friends and groups) for the last couple of months. So, for the sake of encouraging others to join us on Saturday if you in the city (or the tri-state area, or beyond!), here it is, my personal list of tasks I'm willing to work on:
<ul>
	<li>Retake/rewrite the tools and scripts I used to mess <a href="http://debian.org/devel/wnpp">WNPP</a> with.</li>
	<li>Check what other things are missing to improve WNPP.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Deal with some of the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/lists.debian.org">lists.debian.org</a> bugs wearing my listmaster hat.</span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Install Debian on a <a href="http://www.dmp.com.tw/tech/vortex86/">Vortex86</a> machine I've been having around for the last couple of months.</span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dig into Ruby and Perl <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/debian/all.html">RC bugs</a> and try to squash some of them (after all, this is a BSP, and RC bugs is the primary target!).</span></li>
	<li>Encouraging <a href="http://maggit.com.mx">Raquel</a> to take a look at some of the previous <a href="http://www.debian.org">www.debian.org</a> re-design proposals and try to come up with something useful out of it.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Have lots of beer while doing all of above.</span></li>
</ul>
See you at <a href="http://vireo.org">Vireo</a>!

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: The BSP was a lot of fun. Striking now the things I actually did from my list.
