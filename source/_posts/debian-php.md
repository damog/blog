<p>It is not that I work a lot with PHP on Debian, but I really think many people could find a debian-php mailing list useful. That&#8217;s way I filed a Debian bug against lists.debian.org in order to propose the creation of the mailing list. The bug is <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=264069">here</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you think you could find it useful, please write to <a href="mailto:264069@bugs.debian.org">264069@bugs.debian.org</a> telling why. That is how the mailing list is going to be approved.</p>
