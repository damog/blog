I had an exhausting and stressing weekend. We had a long long holiday this week in Mexico. Some people had the week until Tuesday and had from Wednesday to Sunday off, because of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead">Day of the Dead</a> celebration (being Nov 1st and 2nd, and taking Friday 3rd also). I didn&#8217;t have any classes, but the Superior Algebra teacher made us attend an exam on Friday and Saturday (9 am and 8 am, respectively). Some of my friends were high and drunk from Tuesday afternoon and will remain that way until tomorrow, while I had to stay at home and work stressing for my poor understanding on the class, trying to study with tons of things on my head, etc. This so much sucks.

Anyway, last week, <a target="_blank" href="http://raquelhernandez.net/">Raquel</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tacvbo.net/">Tato</a>, Javier and a friend of Tato managed to go to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah_Yeah_Yeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>&#8217; concert, which was fucking amazing. I love <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_O">Karen O</a>, her sex appeal and the way she does to put people in the mood is great and lovely. Unfortunately, Rach hasn&#8217;t put the pics (we got her digital camera inside the building but was discovered by the staff and forced to put it on a stuff hold table, fuckers) yet, I hope she does soon :) The best moment of the concert: <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_with_the_Night">Date with the Night</a>.

Next weekend, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coronamusicfest.com">Corona Music Fest</a> will take place in the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadio_Azteca">Azteca stadium</a>, which has me anxious. I can&#8217;t wait to watch <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta">The Mars Volta</a> on stage. Other nice bands I&#8217;m expecting to watch are <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOFX">NOFX</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clap_Your_Hands_Say_Yeah">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</a>, Resorte, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Gusana_Ciega">La Gusana Ciega</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortec_Collective">Nortec Collective</a>.

Here&#8217;s the flyer:
