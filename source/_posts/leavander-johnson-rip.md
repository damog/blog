<p align="left">Jesús Chávez was challenging Johnson&#8217;s championship which he won in Italy against Steffano Zoff.</p>
<p align="left">The
fight between Johnson and Chávez was stopped on the 11st round by the
referee to give Chávez a technical win. Johnson received around three
bunches of punches in the last moments the fight without any answer
from his side. The referee saw this and stopped the fight. Chávez was
the new champion.</p>
<p align="left">The referee and Johnson&#8217;s crew asked him if he
was OK and he said he was. &#8220;I&#8217;m only a little bit disappointed&#8221;. Chávez
was declared new champion and Johnson, in his way to the dressing
rooms, started to walk dizzy and collapsed. An ambulance took him to
the nearest hospital (in Las Vegas) and, after three hours of surgery,
he died because of a brain hemorrhage. He left three sons and his wife.
Chávez, apparently was creating a fund to help Johnson&#8217;s sons on
school, let&#8217;s see if that is real and not only a press coverage.<br/></p>
<p align="left">Boxing is a dangerous sport, but it is as dangerous as any other
sport can be (I have seen some professional players dying while playing
soccer games on TV). Only in this one, two individuals agree to punch
each other until one of them gets too stupid to keep on fighting, it&#8217;s
up to them. I like it, but you know what they say, shit happens.<br/></p>
