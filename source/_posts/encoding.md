<p>I’ve been fighting against the bad encoding at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.planetalinux.com.mx/">PlanetaLinux</a>. I’ve finally got a correct parsing against <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://jaws-project.sf.net/">JAWS</a> users, but not for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://blogger.com/">Blogger</a> users. Wouldn’t it be easier if all of us used UTF-8 or so?</p>

<p>I’m not releasing PlanetaLinux until I solve those encoding problems and fix the time stuff.</p>
