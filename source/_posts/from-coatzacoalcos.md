<p>Well, I put my ass on a bus, and eight hours later I was in Coatzacoalcos, in the beautiful state of Veracruz, very near to Tabasco.</p>

<p>I came for a couple of days to do some work with Salvador, which is in charge of the <a href="http://www.gulcoatza.org/">Linux User Group of Coatza</a> and besides, he is the founder of the never-born NetBSD-MX project.</p>

<p>Hot? Well, It is 8:21 in the morning, I&#8217;m sitting on a bed with wireless access, with a huge fan next to me, can&#8217;t complain. Yet. I don&#8217;t want to feel the weather at 2&#160;pm or so.</p>

<p>I hope to be in Mexico Shitty by Saturday morning, when have eaten several delicious sea food from Gulf of Mexico ;)</p>
