Recently, I <a href="http://www.lawaloca.com/index.php?gadget=Blog&amp;action=SingleView&amp;id=393" target="_blank">read</a> on <a href="http://www.lawaloca.com" target="_blank">Jordi&#8217;s blog</a> (<a href="http://www.lawaloca.com/index.php?gadget=Blog&amp;action=SingleView&amp;id=100" target="_blank">called <em>Lawaloca</em></a>, explanation in spanish) about <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com" target="_blank">Audioscrobbler</a>.<br/><br/>
This is a music profile builder, which makes a nice webpage with the
music you listen. You have to register in their website, download a
plugin (official Debian packages for some of them are available) for
most of the music players out there (including XMMS/Beep Media Player,
Amarok, Rhythmbox and Windows/MacOS players), activate it by entering
your username and password and that&#8217;s all, start listening to your
music normally. The information of each song is retrieved by their
ID3v2 tags.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/damog" target="_blank">
My profile</a> lists the recently played songs and nice charts by week, top
artists, top songs, etc. You can also have a network connection with
your friends, similar to Orkut. Some recommendations are also made for
you, depending on your track of songs; similar profiles, etc.<br/><br/>
This is a nice, funny thing. Specially since lurking on other profiles
is fun. And yes, this is also a chance to find different and unusual
music all around the globe with real-life people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
