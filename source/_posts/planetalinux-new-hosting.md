Just a very quick shout out.

A few weeks/months ago, <a href="http://planetalinux.org">Planeta Linux</a> lost its hosting. As I'm less and less
involved on third party projects, it was a bit hard for me to just put it somewhere else. <a href="http://blografia.net/vicm3/">VÃ­ctor</a>,
however, approached me and offered to pay for it. A few days later, we hosted Planeta Linux on one of his hosting
instances. A big round of applause goes to him! He is the one making that community possible.

Over and out.
