<p><img align="right" src="http://planeta.debian.net/images/debian.png"/>Recently, a proposal by Alejandro Ríos was made in <a target="_blank" href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-spanish">debian-devel-spanish</a> to provide a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> planet in Spanish to syndicate blogs from developers, maintainers and contributors in that language.</p>

<p>After working a bit (and after my trip to Cuba), we are able to show this to the public. I wish more people contributing with Debian writing blogs in Spanish, could ask their addition by writing to the mailing list; we are only 10 persons there so far.</p>

<p>Join us! <a target="_blank" href="http://planeta.debian.net/"><a href="http://planeta.debian.net/">http://planeta.debian.net/</a></a></p>
