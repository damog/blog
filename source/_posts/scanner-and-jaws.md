<p>I really need an scanner :(</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll start to give some courses on SOFIA (the academic system we have been working on for the last 6 months). Four courses a day, it&#8217;ll be a PITA for sure.</p>

<p>And my time on the computer will be reduced, damn.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have to find some time to package <a href="http://jaws.sf.net/">jaws</a>, which I have a ITP for almost two months and a half. I will probably use Drupal package to get based, as it is a nice and very similar example. Gunnar has warned me he won&#8217;t have a blog until I package jaws - I don&#8217;t know if is proper to cry or laugh :-P</p>

<p>OTH, that package _must_ be finished before I go to DebConf.</p>

<p>So, I _do_ use jaws (I just don&#8217;t use it on this blog, I know) at <a href="http://www.iec.uia.mx/gulibero">GULIbero</a>&#8217;s site. That is because so many people has told me that I should package a software I actually use, and well, I really use it.</p>

<p>jaws is nice, I won&#8217;t share some security bugs on it (for example the 777 mode on xml/ directory), and I&#8217;ll try to contribute it to my upstream friend, <a href="http://ion.gluch.org.mx/">Jonathan Hern√°ndez</a>. I will definitely have news about jaws package on the next days, before thrusday, for sure.</p>
