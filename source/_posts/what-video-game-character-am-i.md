I am <strong>a Defender-ship</strong>.


I am fiercely protective of my friends and loved ones, and unforgiving of any who would hurt them. Speed and foresight are my strengths, at the cost of a little clumsiness. I’m most comfortable with a few friends, but sometimes particularly enjoy spending time in larger groups. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</a></p>
