There's a <a href="http://blog.kraih.com/post/43199102900/mojolicious-in-the-cloud-hello-heroku">few</a> different posts out there on how to run Perl apps, such as Mojolicious-based, on Heroku, but I'd like to show how to deploy a <a href="http://perldancer.org/">Perl Dancer</a> application on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.

The startup script of a Dancer application (bin/app.pl) can be used as a <a href="http://plackperl.org/">PSGI</a> file. With that in mind, I was able to take the good work of <a href="http://bulknews.typepad.com/">Miyagawa's</a> <a href="https://github.com/miyagawa/heroku-buildpack-perl">Heroku buildpack</a> for general PSGI apps and hack it a little bit to use Dancer's, specifically. What I like about Miyagawa's approach is that uses the fantastic <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.5015/bin/cpanm">cpanm</a> and makes it available within your application, instead of the monotonous cpan, to solve dependencies.

Let's make a simple Dancer app to show how to make this happen:

    /tmp $ dancer -a heroku
    + heroku
    + heroku/bin
    + heroku/bin/app.pl
    + heroku/config.yml
    + heroku/environments
    + heroku/environments/development.yml
    + heroku/environments/production.yml
    + heroku/views
    + heroku/views/index.tt
    + heroku/views/layouts
    + heroku/views/layouts/main.tt
    + heroku/MANIFEST.SKIP
    + heroku/lib
    heroku/lib/
    + heroku/lib/heroku.pm
    + heroku/public
    + heroku/public/css
    + heroku/public/css/style.css
    + heroku/public/css/error.css
    + heroku/public/images
    + heroku/public/500.html
    + heroku/public/404.html
    + heroku/public/dispatch.fcgi
    + heroku/public/dispatch.cgi
    + heroku/public/javascripts
    + heroku/public/javascripts/jquery.js
    + heroku/t
    + heroku/t/002_index_route.t
    + heroku/t/001_base.t
    + heroku/Makefile.PL

Now, you already know that by firing `perl bin/app.pl` you can get your development server up and running. So I'll just proceed to show how to make this work on Heroku, you should already have your development environment configured for it:

    /tmp $ cd heroku/
    /tmp/heroku $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/heroku/.git/
    /tmp/heroku :master $ git add .
    /tmp/heroku :master $ git commit -a -m 'Dancer on Heroku'
    [master (root-commit) 6c0c55a] Dancer on Heroku

    create mode 100644 views/index.tt
    create mode 100644 views/layouts/main.tt
    /tmp/heroku :master $

And now, run `heroku create`, please note the buildpack URL, `http://github.com/damog/heroku-buildpack-perl.git`:

    /tmp/heroku :master $ heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/damog/heroku-buildpack-perl.git
    Creating blazing-beach-7280... done, stack is cedar
    http://blazing-beach-7280.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:blazing-beach-7280.git
    Git remote heroku added
    /tmp/heroku :master $

And just push:

    /tmp/heroku :master $ git push heroku master

And you can confirm it works:

Please note that the environment it runs on is "deployment". The backend server it uses is the great Starman, also by the great Miyagawa.

Now, if you add or change dependencies on Makefile.PL, next time you push, those will get updated.

Very cool, right? :)
