<a href="http://maggit.net">We</a> got back from Spain yesterday. It was a nice overall vacation experience but a little too long for our own style and like, specially after spending two weeks in Mexico City. Lots of photos (at least some) are on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/raquelydavid">our Flickr</a> and some more on <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/damog">my TwitPic</a>.

I couldn't be happier to be back in New York.
