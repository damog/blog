I&#8217;ve been thinking what would happen if I were born and living on the other side of the world. I began thinking on that while listening to the wonderful Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra. Would I enjoy that band as much as I do now? Would I be listening to some ska Latin bands and enjoying them as much as I do now? Would I enjoy ska as much as I do now? Of course everything would be different, but I couldn&#8217;t realize of the differences. The only thing I can do is travelling to those places and searching good music there. While I was in Finland, I got a CD of The Valkyrians, a Helsinki ska band. I was unable to find more local ska music since everything I saw on the CDs shelfs was third-wave US bands. If you are interested on exchanging ska/punk/reggae music, please <a href="mailto:damog@damog.net" target="_blank">mail me</a> , mail me now! I&#8217;m planning also a trip to China, Korea and Japan (since I&#8217;m not spending money on travelling to DebConf6 :-) for next year. My very first step was to get a visa interview in the US embassy. I called on Tuesday and they gave me the interview for February 1st. Ana should also try to get her visa as soon as possible. Finding oriental ska would rock my world, definitively :) <br/><br/>
