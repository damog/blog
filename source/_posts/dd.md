After a long NM process, I&#8217;ve became DD today.<br/><br/>
I have to thank people involved directly on my process: Gunnar Wolf for
being my advocate, and actually, he was the one who gave me a Debian CD
to try it for the first time in my life several years ago; Craig Small,
my AM; Anibal Monsalve, who always were there supporting me; Joerg
Jaspert, for whom I deliver desserts everyday at #debian-newmaint ;-);
and all the people working on the NM desk.<br/><br/>
Thanks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
