<p>Just in case you own an iBook (I don&#8217;t really know if it is the same on the PowerBook machines) do not do the following.</p>
<p>If you are giving a talk and for some reason you have to close the lid of your iBook, <b>do not</b> leave the computer near to the projector&#8217;s fan, where the heat is on fire.</p>
<p>My iBook has these little plastic things in the inside part of the lid, on the corners, in the top. After leaving one of the corners near to the fan, my  rubber thing was f**ked up and completely fused.</p>
<p>Now, when closing the lid, this is crooked.</p>
