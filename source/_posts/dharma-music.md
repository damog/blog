<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to this wonderful Tibet music and sounds. Really is very comfortable in a stress situation like this, with this big and mess city, so noisy. It is a better and cheaper solution for problems than mariguana ;-)</p>

<p>I like the Buddhism stuff: Its philosophy, its culture, its music, its feeling, its thought. Listen to it.</p>
