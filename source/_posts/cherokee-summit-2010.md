The <a href="http://cherokee-project.com">Cherokee web server project</a> is hosting the Cherokee Summit 2010 in Madrid, Spain on May 7th and 8th. The summit will be focused on high-performance and scalable Web technologies. I truly believe this is a major opportunity for hackers, developers and administrators looking for the new alternatives on the Web to bond and share experiences to benefit each other's projects and enterprises, and keep up to date on this field.

If you are interested on attending, proceed to the registration site (it's free of charge but seat-limited) and see you there in May!
