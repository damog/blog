I just arrived Madrid around 12 hours ago, after a 11-hour long flight.<br/><br/>I thought the timezone change wouldn&#8217;t affect me since I used to think changing timezones was like going out for party and get back at home late (for example, 6 am :-), but hell no. I arrived 6 am, and by 9:30 I was already sleeping like a baby completely tired.<br/><br/>The bad thing: I&#8217;m now 7 hours older :-(<br/><br/>The good thing: Right now, 7&#160;pm is almost time to party and drink with the guys. At Mexico City, I would be working right now on midday :-)<br/><br/>The ugly thing: <strong>Obviously</strong> everything seems to be more much expensive than what I thought.<br/><br/>But hey, it is very nice over here. I&#8217;m staying with a friend of mine who is studying here in Madrid, her mother sent her a backpack with clothes, candies and <em>tortillas</em> and <em>chilli</em>. :-D<br/><br/><br/>
