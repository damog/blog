<p>The roundtable/BOF in DebConf5 about Debian website was quite
interesting, although I didn&#8217;t participate much, but I was widely
interested on listening to every opinion out there about it, since the
website is one of my big concerns on the project.<br/><br/>
There, I proposed a navigation bar to be included on the header of each
page, displaying the path you have followed, between the directories of
the website (the webwml tree). I think the physical placement of the
files and directories can be an advantage and would be significantly
easy to work with on something like this. Peter Karlson didn&#8217;t agree,
since he thinks lots of work has to be done to have a decent placement
for all the files (in fact, he said one thing quite interesting which I
also have realized in the past: You can always discover cool pages you
have never seen before, in the Debian website, while working on wml
translations).<br/><br/>
Anyway, I still think the navigation bar (not the one called navbar,
already used) can be a good and interesting thing to start playing
with, it probably could give the www team the reason to begin
reorganization of the files on the tree. And well, the biggest concern
on the people attending the talks around Debian website was usability,
and this is my very first small step towards real answers. I still have
to bring this to the discussion on the mailing list, though.<br/><br/>
So, last night I started hacking a bit my local webwml tree (with a
12-beer night break) and ended (not yet really: more CSS design has to
be done and probably the way I&#8217;m doing it can be improved) with
something like this:<br/><br/></p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://nipl.net/%7Edamog/images/lil-yellow-bar.png"><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" src="http://nipl.net/~damog/images/lil-lil-yellow-bar.png"/></a><br/><br/><p>
A rounded left border would be nice, I think. The bar does not interfer with anything in any page and the Perl code is minimal.<br/><br/>
If somebody out there has any kind of comment, please let me know,
probably I&#8217;m just doing it the wrong way, because of (I don&#8217;t know) any
reason.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
