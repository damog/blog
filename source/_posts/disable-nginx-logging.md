This is something that is specified clearly on the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Modules#Nginx_core_modules">Nginx manual</a>, but it's nice to have it as a quick reference.

The <tt>access_log</tt> and <tt>error_log</tt> directives on Nginx are on separate modules (<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLogModule">HTTP Log</a> and <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/CoreModule">Core</a> modules respectively) and they don't behave the same way when all you want is to disable all logging on your server (in our case, <a href="http://nabbr.com/">we</a> serve a gazillion static files and perform a lot of reverse proxying and we're not interested on tracking that). It's a common misconception that you can set error_log to off, because that's how you disable access_log (if you do that, the server will still log to the file <tt>$nginx_path/off</tt>). Instead, you have to set <tt>error_log</tt> to log to the always mighty black hole <tt>/dev/null</tt> using the highest level for logging (which triggers the fewest events), <tt>crit</tt>:

[code]http {
  server {
    # ...
    access_log off;
    error_log /dev/null crit;
    # ...
  }
  #...
}[/code]

If you're the possessor of the blingest of bling-bling, you can disable all logging (not only for a server block), by putting <tt>error_log</tt> on the root of the configuration and <tt>access_log</tt> within your http block and make sure you don't override that on any of the inner blocks. And you're good to go.
