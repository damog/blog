<p>So, we will be moving to New York City, starting next week. We hope to spend a year there, but who knows, we might be there for only a few months, weeks, or more than a year! Life changes, that&#8217;s why we are moving now, right? :) Only constant is change, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Anyway, we are pretty excited about this. This has been something we have been expecting since May/June and we are finally ready to go, we&#8217;ll see how it goes, hopefully good. School from my side will have to get stalled, again. I&#8217;ll be able to study there, but don&#8217;t know for sure now, we are trying to settle first, and then see possibilities.</p>

<p>So, if you know/have contact with, a good place in Manhattan, Brooklyn or perhaps Queens, please let me know, that&#8217;d be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Bummer, yet another two Mexicans in the States :-D</p>

<p><em>UPDATE: Of course, I&#8217;m looking for a good place to live (apartment in rent, or similar). Everything else has already been covered. :)Â </em></p>
