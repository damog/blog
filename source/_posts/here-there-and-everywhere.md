<p>I&#8217;m feeling kinda sad. Because many things in Mexico suck.</p>

<p>Getting back from Brazil, made me realize that Mexico needs too much for being a better country, starting from the citizens: The common society.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m feeling lazy, frustrated, sad: My stomach is getting worst than ever. And work is so boring.</p>
