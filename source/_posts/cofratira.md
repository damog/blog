<p>I&#8217;ve been making some drawings for <a href="http://www.cofradia.org/">La Cofradía Digital</a>. I really like about drawing the first square, but when coming to second and third is kind of heavy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I remember the time when I used to draw more: I was around 12 or 13, drawing Street Fighter characters ^_^ (I&#8217;ve been playing SF with Toño, my pal, with mame at work, it&#8217;s nice).</p>

<p>So, I think LiveJournal is nice: the LogJam client is easy, and you can reach some interesting features: Mood and logjam-xmms. Easy thing for an easy day.</p>
