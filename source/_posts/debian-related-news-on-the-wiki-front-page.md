<p>I commented <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kitenet.net/~joey/">Joey</a>, on <a href="http://www.debconf.org">DebConf</a>, about an idea on bringing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debian-news.net">Debian-News.net</a> news syndication into the front page of the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.debian.org/">Debian Wiki</a>, on some similar way as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> displays current news on their main page. After thinking a bit more on the idea, and after actually receiving a green light on the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.debian.org/WikiBoF">Debian Wiki BOF</a>, I thought it would be better if we could include more than only one feed, so we could include more Debian-related news sites, like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debian-administration.org/">Debian Administration</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debcentral.org/">DebCentral</a>, etc, as well as some other official feeds like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debian.org/security/">DSAs</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly">DWNs</a>.</p>

<p>So, after setting a local <a target="_blank" href="http://www.planetplanet.org">Planet</a> up and writing a little script, we ended up with the <em>Latest official and unofficial Debian-related news</em> box on the wiki <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.debian.org/FrontPage">FrontPage</a>, which I hope people would like.</p>

<p>Further information about this is can be found at the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.debian.org/FrontPageNews">FrontPageNews</a> page.</p>
