<p>While reading the available documentation on <a target="_blank" href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/">Joey Hess</a>&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://ikiwiki.kitenet.net">ikiwiki</a>, I started to see his pics on previous DebConfs. It&#8217;s amazing how quick things can happen. It seemed to me <a target="_blank" href="http://debconf5.debconf.org">DebConf5</a> happened last week or something and we are now facing the Mexican <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debconf.org/">DebConf</a> in a couple of days. :D</p>

<p>Last months have been passing quickly, events and people around me are being completely appreciated and loved from my part. And now DebConf is here. Just here. It&#8217;s true that I wasn&#8217;t able to help as I wished on the organization people, because of my moving to Venezuela in the last couple of months, but DebConf, and everything around it, is starting this week for me. Tomorrow, being <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers%27_Day">International Workers&#8217; Day</a>, I will be shooting pictures from the airport to the Taxqueña bus station (and all the way on the subway), in order to help the tutorial on <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebConf6HowtoGetToOaxtepec">how to get to Oaxtepec</a>. On Tuesday I will be heading to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.inm.gob.mx">Instituto Nacional de Migración</a> for some personal issues. On Wednesday, I&#8217;ll be picking <em>rubito-güerito</em> up from the airport. On Thursday, we&#8217;ll be heading to Oaxtepec and on Friday and Saturday more friends are arriving :). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwolf.org/">Gunnar</a> has also asked me if I can pick a couple of servers up at HP during the week.</p>

<p>DebConf will start for me this week, and I&#8217;m really excited about it. :)</p>
