If you use any <em>non</em>-retarded Web browser (aka not Internet Explorer) and usually run into and enjoy the huge inventory of videos that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> has to offer, please consider opting in to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">YouTube's HTML5 trial</a>, which means that you'll be running HTML5 browser-based video instead of <a href="http://flashsucks.org/">Flash</a> for most of the website's videos. If you're also nerd enough, make sure to send them <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/label">feedback</a> and shit.
