It's very pleasant for me to announce that the probably <em>most descriptive domain name in Mexico for Linux</em>, <a href="http://linux.org.mx/"><strong>linux.org.mx</strong></a>, is now powered by <a href="http://planetalinux.org/mx">Planeta Linux México</a>.

I see this as a great milestone of all the members of the Mexican Linux community that have made Planeta Linux the number one <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=linux%20mexico">Web site in Mexico for Linux</a>. Also, please raise your drinks for @<a href="http://twitter.com/negrabarba">negrabarba</a>, who made this possible, administrator of the DNS at <a href="http://www.upn.mx">UPN</a>, where the domain name points to; and of course for <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/">Miguel</a>, the owner of it.
