<p>Apparently I cannot export images from my computer onto my <a href="http://latinoamerica.ext.nokia.com/phones/gallery/view_product.asp?id=2819">Nokia 3300</a>.

That is totally insane. Everything in it rocks, except for that. I have to receive an image, and then connect to it as a URL/WAP location.
