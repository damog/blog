<p>We took two days off and went home to see our folks, family and friends. <b>Superb</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>The good:</i> Mexico City at around 30C.</li>
<li>
<i>The bad:</i> Getting a bit more exhausted than I usually am.  </li>
<li>
<i>The ugly:</i> MTA Subway. For real, ultimately, we cannot trust it anymore on our way <b>to</b> and <b>back</b> JFK. Ugly and sad. </li>
</ul>
