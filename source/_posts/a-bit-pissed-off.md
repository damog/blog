<p>After the start of the DebCamp I&#8217;m just pissed off about just everything. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s because people could expect you to do something you aren&#8217;t supposed to do; or because people are just trying to do children pranks and only look like adult morons; or because I&#8217;m just exhausted of children urinating in the pool; or because of the heat; or because I&#8217;m supposed to handle all the jokes about Mexican food; or because of having to go to school everyday; or because of having to skip my classes; or because of missing Ana, missing Venezuela; or because of the fact that I won&#8217;t be able to get the money I&#8217;m spending on DebConf back; or just because every fucking thing around me.</p>

<p>On the other hand, just as I heard Holger saying: &#8220;I will try to relax and have fun&#8221;, and won&#8217;t give a shit at anything not worthwhile.</p>
