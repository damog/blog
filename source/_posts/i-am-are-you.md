<p>You really have to be a fucking son of a bitch for living in a world where you go out and see everyday’s people living on extreme poorness, unfairness all over the place, six year-olds performing like clowns on red stops and your fellow compatriots dying on the streets, among hundreds of all other kinds of shit happening. You really have to be one when, after all of that, you finally arrive and seat on your so comfortable chair and start blogging, working with free software or playing a movie on your iPod.</p>

<p>We are all so cynic, and I’m particularly bitter.</p>
