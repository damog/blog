<p>Today, I bought a couple of .mx domains, since they are on some kind of special offer, quite cheap.</p>

<p>The interesting domain I bought was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://debian.com.mx/">debian.com.mx</a> which will point, at least now, to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.debianmexico.org/">Debian MÃ©xico</a> project. I’m hoping to get <em>debian.net.mx</em> once, but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.nic.mx/">NIC MX</a> is in general a bad service.</p>

<p>I’ll somewhat busy in the next few days, mainly because of an AutoCAD project that I have to deliver tomorrow, and a physics exam some day, don’t know yet the exact date. Besides, I’ve plenty things to do.</p>

<p>And, BTW, I have changed some of the main pictures of the website. Some of them are incredibly cute <sup>_</sup></p>
