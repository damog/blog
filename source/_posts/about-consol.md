<p><a href="http://www.consol.org.mx">CONSOL</a> is finally over. Organization stuff has been pretty tiring this year. But I&#8217;m widely satisfied what we&#8217;ve reached: Being probably the most important free software conference in Mexico.</p>
<p>Not too much people attended this year, but I&#8217;m happy I could shake hands with lots of them. I want to thank specially Steve Langasek, who only could be here three days; Gustavo Noronha, what could I say about him? kov rocks ;-) and Fernanda Weiden who gave CONSOL a nice and interesting &#8220;Free software with a female touch&#8221; talk.</p>
<p>Mexico has not too many people involved in Debian development, there are obviuosly more user parties: I&#8217;m definitively convinced this should change, that&#8217;s why I tried to give two talks about it, one about helping the Debian project (in some of the common tasks) and one about package creation. I really enjoyed giving this last one, it was on a room with 20 computers, which every one of them had an interested people on it. Even some other persons gathered on the halls trying to see the workshop (kov sat on the rug with his laptop ;-).</p>
<p>2005 is only two months old, but we&#8217;ve having a feeling more free software development and usage (as well as nice conferences) will be coming. Just for 2006 there would be some other interesting conferences: CONSOL, DebConf6, LinuxWorld (rumors say it will be held in Mexico - at least a Latin(?) version), and some kind of mexican GUADEC (with the folks of the Novell Ximian mexican office).</p>
