Today, fifty years ago, my mother was born.

On July 24th, 1958, Vicenta Leyva gave birth to Olga Cristina Garza Leyva in the small town of Zumpango del Río (later renamed to Eduardo Neri), in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero. Her father Guillermo Garza, who is still alive, was a private pilot. Olga Cristina was named Cristina after the saint that is celebrated on the same day.

She was their third kid, a couple of years before Víctor and Guillermo were born and a couple of years after, Carlos was born, all of them being born on total different places on southern and central Mexico. The father, being a pilot, was absent from home for long periods, he even had "another family" somewhere in northern Mexico, supposedly in Sinaloa.

In the early 60s, the family moved to Mexico City where they were going to spend most of their life. They lived on a small apartment on Col. Moctezuma, which was (and still is) a working class neighborhood, just besides the Mexico City International Airport, on the eastern part of the city. Back in the days, it used to take quite some time to travel from there to any point of the city, like the downtown area or beyond.

All the kids spent most of their childhood there attending public schools. They weren't a wealthy family who couldn't even afford to buy and have meat on some days but only in special ocassions.

As the years passed and the kids became adults, Olga met David Moreno Rojas in the same neighborhood. He was enrolled at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, under Enterprises Administration in Ciudad Universitaria. He was also an avid fútbol player. He was named David after his father, David Moreno González. They became boyfriend and girlfriend and got married when she was 20 and he was 24 years old on December 19th, 1978. They lived together for a few years in Col. Del Valle in central Mexico City.

Ten months later they were married, Lorena Moreno Garza, their first kid, was born on October 7th, 1979. S The family then moved to the suburb in Aragon, Estado de México. They had their second child on August 8th, 1984, named David Moreno Garza, becoming David III.

After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Mexico_City_earthquake">1985 Mexico City massive earthquake</a>, the family wanted to move outside the city and found relocation in Ciudad del Carmen, on the Mexican state of Campeche, located on the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, on 1988. They spent three or four years there and then moved to Celaya, Guanajuato where most of the father's family was located. They spent about five years there and then, for family reasons, they returned to Mexico City in 1995 to attend the family business.

Olga and her family had a good, loving family by then and had decided to not have any more kids. They had both of their children on private schools and taught them catholicism. On 1998, Vicenta passed away after a quick period of time because of liver cancer. This shocked most of the family.

As the years passed, the family business was sold and Olga stopped working, as she used to in the business. But as she had always been very active, she started working as a seller for a fine jewelry firm where she keeps working currently. Her husband, after pursuing his dream of going back to school and studying Law, works as a private work-related issues lawyer.

Olga is the most loving, nursing, affective, meticulous, scrupulous person I've ever met and even though I have only met her for almost twenty-four of her fifty years now, I admire her and love her as much as I have no words to describe. She is the one that built my sensitive, loving side where my heart resides, and I thank God for giving me such a great life gift and having her at any time.
