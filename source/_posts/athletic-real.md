<p> Unfortunately, when we arrived to his flat, he
turned on the TV and there was a replay of the game on ESPN, so we saw
the match was 1-1 in minute 60. Crap, 2/3 of the game spoiled. Anyway,
we saw the whole 60 minutes (with beer, without it it would have been
impossible :)). After the 60 minutes, Real Madrid scored two times
more, so they ended 3-1.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not a huge Spanish fútbol fan,
I was cheering Athletic with him. After the match he was swearing with
a funny Spaniard accent: &#8220;<i>¡Jodeeeeeeeer, me cago en la putaaaaaa! ¡Putos fascistas de mieeeeeeeeeerda!</i>&#8221;. But the funniest part was swearing Mexican style: &#8220;<i>¡Que chingue a su madre, el pinche Real Madrid!</i>&#8221;. ;-)</p>
<p>He&#8217;s
a  great guy. If I ever visit Spain again, I&#8217;ll definitively visit
him in the Basque country (if he happens to be back in <i>La Madre Patria</i>).<br/></p>
