<a target="_blank" href="http://www.catpowerthegreatest.com/">Cat Power</a><p> is coming town. Yay! If you, by any chance, have an spare ticket, I definitively can do slave work to get it :-) Because, just as my magical way to concerts, I simply don&#8217;t get tickets on time and then I just have left the tears for missing nice concerts (and also, I prefer concerts where tickets are sold by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smartticket.com.mx">SmartTicket</a> and not by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ticketmaster.com.mx">TicketMaster</a>, which is an evil way to get tickets :P). </p>
