<p>July 31st was my last day working for Sixbell-Nekotec Solutions (formerly known as Nekotec Tecnología). I lasted there three years. It seems like a life was spent there, heh: I entered after turning 20 and I’m leaving some days before I turn 23.</p>

<p><a href="http://raquelhernandez.net/" target="_blank">Our</a> future is still a bit fuzzy, but we are working on it. In the meantime, I’m getting back full-time to <a href="http://www.matematicas.unam.mx/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> next 13rd. But if our plans succeed and if everything goes right, we’ll be moving by the end of August or early September. Heh, yes, leaving school temporarily, again!</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m unemployed right now. <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/damog" target="_blank">Listening</a> to music most part of the day, taking Raquel to work, coding a bit here, there, doing some Debian labor, etc.</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>An End Has A Start is one of the albums by the English band, The Editors, it makes a great title for my post now :-). I just listened to Taraf de Haïdouks’ Maskarada, it’s not that great as the masterpiece as The Continuing Adventures. I’m getting addicted to the Cold War Kids.</p>
