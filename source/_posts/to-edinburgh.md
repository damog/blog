<p>I just booked and paid my tickets to reach Edinburgh next month and attend <a href="http://debconf7.debconf.org/" target="_blank">DebConf7</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll be flying to New York on June, 16th through Delta from MEX. Then, I’ll go over the Atlantic with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyglobespan" target="_blank">Flyglobespan</a>, from JFK to Liverpool John Lennon Airport. From there, I’m still not completely sure, but I guess I’ll go by train to Edinburgh. Same way to return, on Sunday 24th, after spending a Saturday night in NYC.</p>

<p>There’s a small thing that it’s still worrying me. I got the best deal ever from the US to the UK with Flyglobespan, but their first transatlantic flight will be by the end of May and I’m travelling in the middle of June. So, I’m bit skeptical on the matter. But reaching the UK from the US for only 550 USD, return, was impressive and I took the chance. If I don’t appear on DebConf on Sunday 17th around midday, it’ll be because I’ll be in NYC waiting for some answers from Flyglobespan.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just moved and this travel expense was not easy. Actually, I wasn’t considering to attend, but after receiving sponsorship, I reconsidered and well, it couldn’t be possible at all without the support of the DebConf orga team, <a href="http://www.gwolf.org/" target="_blank">Gunnar</a>, who lent me the sponsorship money for faster and local moves; my employer who is paying the MEX-JFK-MEX flight, but after all, my beloved fiancée, <a href="http://www.maggit.com.mx/" target="_blank">Raquel</a>, who has been an incredible support for a guy like me (a fat, lazy, farty, stupid, anger-tending dude). I really, couldn’t be the happiest person I am today, without you: I love you, peque :-).</p>

<p>Have I mentioned that any Debian friend visiting Mexico City can crash on our apartment? Yes! Just like <a href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/" target="_blank">bubulle</a>’s hotel in Paris! ;-)</p>
