A year ago today, I [started working](/blog/2012/08/18/another-day-another-dawn/) for [Booking.com](http://booking.com). I wish I could say that the time has flown by, but it really hasn't. It has been one hell of a ride on all fronts: work, learning experiences, friends, but specially at home, since working for this company didn't come without a complete life change. So far so good, and for that I'm grateful :)
