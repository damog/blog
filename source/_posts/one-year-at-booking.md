A year ago today, I <a href="/blog/another-day-another-dawn.html">started working</a> for <a
href="http://booking.com">Booking.com</a>. I wish I could say that the time has
flown by, but it really hasn't. It has been one hell of a ride on all fronts:
work, learning experiences, friends, but specially at home, since working for
this company didn't come without a complete life change. So far so good, and for
that I'm grateful :)
