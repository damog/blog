Thanks to the fifty persons that signed the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/abrotman/petition.html">petition</a> regarding abrotman coming to DebConf6! Unfortunately, the guys at Petiton Online temporarily disabled the petition due to anonymous postage, which I had already certified and didn&#8217;t get a reply (the bastards).In spite of abrotman&#8217;s undecision, here is, for everybody&#8217;s joy, a picture of him at a wedding party:
