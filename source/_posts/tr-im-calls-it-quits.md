It's very sad when projects close down because of lack of financial interest on them. I've seen that on very near projects to me in the last couple of years and it doesn't stop getting me sad. Now, it's [tr.im](http://tr.im), which was a nice URL shortening service.

They weren't, of course, anything new, but it was really cool. They had a great short domain name and it just worked, plus they weren't one of the shitty services like [Twitter](http://twitter.com)-whore [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) or elder [TinyURL](http://tinyurl.com).

I had my [Tweeties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweetie) (Mac's and iPhone's) configured to short my URLs using it so I will have to migrate to something else. Thing is, I didn't like any of others as much as I liked `tr.im`. Life's hard now.

Too bad. Good luck to the [Nambu](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nambu-networks/) team and thanks for all the fish.
