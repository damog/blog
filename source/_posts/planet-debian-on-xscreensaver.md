The other day, at work, I was fooling around the lab (I work on common
area called &#8216;lab&#8217; where the different products of the company I work
for are assembled) and while looking at any random point I was
surprised to see my machine with a black background, huge terminal-like
green fonts displaying: &#8220;<a href="http://paul.luon.net" target="_self">Paul van Tilburg</a>: 25th birthday&#8230;&#8221;. Shit! Mozillion has cracked up my box! :-)<br/><br/>
But after reading a little
bit more, I was happy to realize one of the screensavers on
xscreensaver has an RSS p.d.o reader :-) That is indeed very, very nice.<br/><br/><br/>
