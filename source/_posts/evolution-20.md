<p>Well, it is almost 5 am, but I did it ;-) <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution">Evolution 2.0</a> running over <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>.

You probably may not heard about Evo2. Evolution 2, AFAIK, was intended to be released with GNOME 2.8 (out today), but didn&#8217;t make it. It is not officially released, but it exists as stable in GNOME ftp&#8217;s. I&#8217;m going to do a couple of packages for running normally Evolution 2 over SID, libgtkhtml, evolution-data-server and so.

Here is my Evolution 2 screenshot:
