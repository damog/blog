Thanks to [Jamie](http://twitter.com/macwarlock), who used to have the name registered and now handed it over, Twitter Debian's [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) username is now [**@debian**](http://twitter.com/debian) (go follow Jamie now!). If you were already following `@debianproject`, nothing will change.

Having **@debian**> on Twitter is actually kind of awesome!
