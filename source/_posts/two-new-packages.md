<p>I uploaded two new packages today, GParted and fteqcc. <br/><br/>
Random thoughts:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>In the next days, I&#8217;ll be using some of the patches made
available in the CVS for gparted. The version that&#8217;ll hit unstable is
raw 0.0.8.<br/>
</li>
<li>fteqcc is the FTE QuakeC compiler, which between other things,
will make possible for nexuiz to enter the archive. This was the first
step to bring nexuiz officially to Debian.</li>
<li>Being suscribed to debian-wnpp@lists.debian.org is quite fun and you always can help a bit people dealing with wnpp bugs.</li>
<li>Pretending you don&#8217;t need glasses doesn&#8217;t work anymore. I have
received the ones I ordered last week today and now I can see clearly,
heh.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m getting ready to start my portuguese lessons on the Brazilian embassy in middle September.</li>
</ul>
