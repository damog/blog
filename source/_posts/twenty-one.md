<p>A day like today, but 21 years ago, I was born. Random thoughts:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>I hosted a birthday party last friday. All my dearest friends were there.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m now able to drink with <a href="http://phoenix.lhup.edu/~abrotman/" target="_blank">abrotman</a> in Philadelphia! ;-)</li>
<li>It sucks that my back-to-school day is my birthday.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://blog.tacvbo.net" target="_blank">Tato</a>, one of my high school homies, will also be 21 on the 11st.</li>
<li>I felt asleep on my own party last friday because I was too drunk
(at 1:30 am). My guests left around 4 or 5. That happens when you are
still 20 ;-)</li>
<li>I watched a The Simpsons episode today where Bart is feeling he is not a kid anymore.</li>
<li>This is actually the beginning of my third decade of life. And saying that sounds like 30s.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m getting old very quickly.</li>
</ul>
