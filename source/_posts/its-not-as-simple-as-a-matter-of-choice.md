<p><a href="http://mjr.towers.org.uk/blog/2007/debian#climatedebconf" target="_blank">MJ</a>, in 3rd world countries, some things like technology, travelling or taking care of the environment are not a matter of choice, unfortunately. When some of the basic needs for humans to live are easily covered and people do not have to worry about, suchs as daily eating, it&#8217;s way more easy to develop a country and have people concerning about unimportant stuff. Even free software is a luxury matter on some countries! You know, human beings have an stupid custom acquired since they were born, most of them, and that&#8217;s the need for eating, how weaks!</p>

<p>I think you get my point.</p>
