Congratulations to all of them who have helped on the Debian project
and specially with the release of Sarge. I truly appreciate everyone&#8217;s
effort: Debian wouldn&#8217;t be the nicest (and beloved, by myself) free
software project without all the people involved.<br/><br/>
I am very excited about this. <br/><br/><br/>
