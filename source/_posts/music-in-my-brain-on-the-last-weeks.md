<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tacvbo.net">Tato</a><p>, <a target="_blank" href="http://raquelhernandez.net/">Raquel</a> and me headed to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Power">Cat Power</a>&#8217;s concert last Wednesday. Luckily, I won two tickets for the concert on a morning radio show (it was around 6 am, so when the speaker asked a question, I had plenty of time to open my notebook, confirm the answer on Wikipedia and call the station; because of the time, the call entered quite quickly, on the 3rd try). It was a double, so Tato had to buy his own ticket.

Chan Marshall, Cat Power&#8217;s real name, is quite interesting. She asked previously that people people should be quiet while performing because of her stage fright (!). She also likes to cut her songs abruptly complaining on the sound of the piano, tunes on the guitar, her voice, the accoustics on the place, etc. We also realized that her live performance is completely depressive, and the ambient of people (quiet, clapping to support her, proposals to marry her from girls) makes an outstanding and not common at all atmosphere.

She played for like two hours in complete absense of noise (except when people clapped or shouted to ask for some songs, or to laugh at her jokes -like the one asking people what would be a better place to live, Mexico or Japan, guess the answer of people-). You could even hear beer bottles rolling in the halls and people doing like &#8220;shhhh&#8221;: the silence was terrific. She also played the day after, but that date was announced like one week before and didn&#8217;t get much people.

No pics since from previous experiences, photos of my cell phone are completely sucky in darkness.

Other concerts I&#8217;ve gone in the last weeks: <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strokes">The Strokes</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babas%C3%B3nicos">Babas√≥nicos</a>. Next concerts I&#8217;ll be going: <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah_Yeah_Yeahs">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> (that&#8217;ll be fucking awesome, can&#8217;t wait for it).

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rabade.net/">MiG</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/risotas">his girlfriend</a> went yesterday to watch the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/loskfm">Kung Fu Monkeys</a>, a nice ska-punk band from Tijuana, but we were too tired to show up in the place. The day before, on Thursday, he also invited us to watch some <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_rock">surf</a> bands, which scene is awesome in Mexico City, it was really nice and we had the chance to dance a bit. :-)
