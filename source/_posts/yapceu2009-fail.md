Given an awful work/travel schedule that I couldn't handle in the last days, I wasn't able to get to Lisbon, Portugal to attend <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/">YAPC::EU</a>, until today, day one of the conference, I was still looking forward to get a <em>cheapish</em> flight from Madrid, but it was just impossible, schedules wouldn't match with my work and vacation plans. <strong>Bummer</strong>. Because of this, I will not be able to give my talk <em>Perl in the Time of Social Networks</em> (that I had already revisited and improved) there as it was expected for tomorrow.

No YAPC Europe for me :( At least not this year, *sob, sob*
