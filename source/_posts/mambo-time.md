I&#8217;ve started to play a little bit with <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com">mambo</a>, which is an
incredibly nice tool for a web cms: It&#8217;s easy to use, to enhance and
work on it. I&#8217;ve also started to work on a Debian package, which was in
the past RFP&#8217;ed, and I&#8217;ve added some interesting stuff in to the
package: <br/><br/>
For example, I&#8217;m using mambo right now at my website/weblog. All
content items in Mambo can be classified into categories and these,
into sections. One of the main problems I found while installing it was
the RSS feed. Only items published on the front page are allowed to be
syndicated. But what happens if I want to syndicate an specific
category, which is not published into the front page? Specially since I
need feeds for my spanish and english blog. So, with a nice and small
Perl script (thanks Jay Bonci for maintaing libxml-rss-perl ;-) I&#8217;ve
produced the RSS feeds of whatever you want containing items.<br/><br/>
I&#8217;ve also implemented the AkoComment stuff, which is a fancy
component/mambot for the items, it allows, as its name suggests, place
comments on your items.<br/><br/>
I guess I can offer the package in a couple of days. I&#8217;d love to have
also authors&#8217;; permissions for distributing some of the incredible cool
themes out there for mambo.<br/><br/>
Besides, I love everything around it, the website is incredibly clean and elegant, so does the cms and the ease of use.<br/><br/>
BTW, do you all know about the new <a href="http://www.debianvenezuela.org">debian<b>venezuela</b>.org</a>?
This tendency is growing up&#8230;<br/><br/><br/>
