<p>Today I have been atacked by a flu. I hate the sore throat, the body pain, headache, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, today it was my sister’s birthday. She is 25 now, and to bother her I tell her, she is a quater of century years old, sounds older <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"/> I gave her a nice tiny blue sweater as present. Anyway, sweaters are cheaper on summer <img alt="smile.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/smile.png"/></p>

<p>I hope this weekend the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://debcontrol.alioth.debian.org/">dcontrol team</a> will be launching a survey for Debian users. I have been thinking on it. I don’t want to send the announce mail of it to only <a href="mailto:debian-user_at_lists_dot_debian_dot_org">debian-user mailing list</a>. It would be nice to have translations, in order to allow any kind of user to answer it, because that is whay we are looking for in Debian Desktop: Make life easier and nicer <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"/> So, we could probably translate the survey strings to Spanish, French, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese (remember, they like to do anything like pt_BR way), German, etc, etc, etc. So, if you are interested on helping us to translate into your language, please <a href="mailto:damog_at_damog_dot_net">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>I think that’s it for today. I’m really in pain <img alt="sad.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/sad.png"/></p>
