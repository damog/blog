Last Sunday, I went out with my parents, sis and some uncles and aunts
to have breakfast at a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.batista.org/carnit.html">carnitas</a> place. It was pretty cool. After the
food, we went to the ice cream store. In our way back, I found
something that couldn&#8217;t find a better word for than &#8220;naquísimo&#8221;:<br/><br/><img vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="middle" src="http://damog.puntodeb.net/misc/escapote.jpg"/><br/><br/>
Can you believe this? This is one of those Volkswagen Sedan, which are
incredible popular in Mexico, commonly named &#8220;vocho&#8221; (called &#8220;fusca&#8221; in
Brazil, thanks <a target="_blank" href="http://couve.no-ip.org/~kov">kov</a> ;-). I remember <a target="_blank" href="http://mako.cc/">Mako</a>,
when he was here last December, thinking on carrying some of those to
NYC and sell them, since apparently they are very expensive there, heh.
Kov also noticed the large amount of those old beetles. Fusca!<br/><br/>
The thing is that the exhaust pipe&#8217;s (thanks to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~four_colours/" target="_blank">Phated</a>, who told me the
name in English &#8216;cause I didn&#8217;t know it) length was like 30 cms.
Actually, while taking the pic (not high quality since I took it with
my phone), a person walking tried to pass between the two vehicles by
jumping (and almost falling down) that &#8220;naquísima&#8221; thing.<br/><br/>
And well, the car is not even like pimped. The car was almost a piece
of trash, it is not nice, come on. I think a &#8220;naco&#8221; in a case like this
is called &#8220;guarro&#8221; in Spain.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
