My friend <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~amnesiac/">Marco</a> first told me on IM, then I read it on <a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/12/higher-order-perl-available-for-free-download.html">PerlBuzz</a>. The nice <strong>High-Order Perl</strong> book by
Mark Jason Dominus is now available for free (as in free beer) at its <a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/">website</a>.

This book caught my attention a long time ago on a Barnes &amp; Noble once, but since I had just too many book on queue, I decided not to buy it. I then read that it's actually a good book on "advanced" techniques on Perl, so my interest grew, but for random reasons I just didn't get it.

Now I have no excuses not to, and either do you :)
