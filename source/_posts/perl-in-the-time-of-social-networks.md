This is going to be a fantastic and exciting Perl summer.

During the last week, I received notification that the talk I've proposed for both [YAPC::NA](http://yapc10.org/yn2009/) and [YAPC::EU](http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2009/), was accepted.

I will be talking about *Perl in the Time of Social Networks*, which is mainly two broad things: how Perl can actively power a modern social networking site (I'll be releasing a free -*as in speech*- social network website, similar to [Lovd](https://github.com/stevenbristol/lovd-by-less) or [RailSpace](https://www.amazon.com/RailsSpace-Building-Networking-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321480791), built with pure [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/)); and about high-load applications dealing with social networks' APIs and users (a [Moose](http://moose.iinteractive.com/en/)-based universal social network distributor), with [Twitter](http://twitter.com), [Facebook](http://facebook.com), [MySpace](http://myspace.com), [Blogger](http://blogger.com), [LastFM](http://last.fm), and others. My current contractor has been sponsoring the development and research for this since almost two years now, and we believe it's ready to go public: there's a lot of work backing us up.

I'll be presenting [the talk](http://yapc10.org/yn2009/talk/2019) in Pittsburgh, PA, on [June 23rd](http://yapc10.org/yn2009/schedule?day=2009-06-23) at YAPC|10. If you are around the area, come and attend the talk!

On YAPC::EU::2009, I will be presenting in Lisbon, Portugal, on August 4th, which is conveniently placed just after [DebConf 9](http://debconf9.debconf.org), which will happen in CÃ¡ceres, Spain the week before (I will also be there).
