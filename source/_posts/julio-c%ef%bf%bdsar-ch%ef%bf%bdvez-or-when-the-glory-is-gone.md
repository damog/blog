<p>The most valuable Mexican boxing fighter, Julio C鳡r Chávez
(106-6-1), fought yesterday on one of his goodbye presentations, on an
event called &#8220;Adiós Arizona&#8221;, in Phoenix.</p>
<p>JC Chávez
is not the same he was ten years ago. He&#8217;s old (43), he&#8217;s slow and
lost last night&#8217;s fight because of a broken hand in the 5th round. He&#8217;s
a complete shame, he represents exactly what a great sport player
should not do when they reach glory: They should retire when they are
in the top, so other cannot use them as stairs after to climb up.</p>
<p>He
lost against an mid-ranked american called Grover, &#8220;the Punisher&#8221;
Wiley. Chávez was one of my heros, he had his own SNES game that rocked
my youngest days.</p>
<p>The good thins is that his son
(Julio César Chávez Jr., 22-0) is a very promising young star in the
boxing field. He also fought yesterday and KO&#8217;ed in the 2nd round.</p>
<p>It was a shame to see JC Cháves lose in the independence day weekend. </p>
