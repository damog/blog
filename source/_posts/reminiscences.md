<p>Something was funny yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glib.org.mx">GLIB</a> (Grupo de Usuarios de Linux del Baj√≠o). Yesterday they had a meeting in Celaya, which is my born town. They invited me, and because of the place of the meeting I immediately accepted it: It would be fantastic to go to a Linux talk in the town where I were born and grew up.</p>
<p>After the talk, I realized how things can change. When I left Celaya to come to Mexico City I was 11 years old. I had no idea what was Linux and Debian about, I didn&#8217;t even own a computer, I was just concerned of riding my bike and playing around my neighborhood. Now, almost 10 years later, it is hard to believe how people can change, how life can turn around on every unbelivable direction.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if there was any free software activity in Celaya back in 1996, when I was more interested on playing soccer on the streets. But it&#8217;s incredibly refreshing to see how this movement is reaching every time and every part of everybody&#8217;s life: Even in Celaya.</p>
