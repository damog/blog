After a while, I ended up building [WWW::Tumblr](https://metacpan.org/pod/release/DAMOG/WWW-Tumblr-2/lib/WWW/Tumblr.pm) (implementing the [Tumblr API](http://www.tumblr.com/api)), so that [Blog::Normalize::Tumblr](https://metacpan.org/pod/release/DAMOG/Blog-Normalize-0.0rc2/lib/Blog/Normalize/Tumblr.pm) can easily replace scrapping. The interesting part would be to write small applications to interact with the `WWW::Tumblr` to handle your tumblelog. Only file uploads missing for now. For now.
