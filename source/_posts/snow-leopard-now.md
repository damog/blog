We ordered a family pack of Snow Leopard for the whole development team last Tuesday. They arrived yesterday Friday, early morning.

A few thing don't work entirely as they were, which was expectable, among other things: <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> starts broken (but you simply have to upgrade to the actual Snow Leopard version). <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/visor/visor">Visor</a> only works on position Full-Screen. <a href="http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatmenus/">iStat Menus</a> simply doesn't. No support for <a href="http://growl.info/documentation/growlmail.php">GrowMail</a> yet neither. And everything else does, as far as I can tell.

I will post updates on those products as soon as they happen.
