Since there were lots of interest on the RSS feed for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly">Debian Weekly News</a>, I&#8217;ve moved it from the previous server into <em>gluck</em> now (run every Tuesday midnight). Fetch it at <a target="_blank" href="http://people.debian.org/~damog/dwn/dwn.xml"><a href="http://people.debian.org/~damog/dwn/dwn.xml">http://people.debian.org/~damog/dwn/dwn.xml</a></a>.
