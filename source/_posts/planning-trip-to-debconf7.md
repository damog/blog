<p>I&#8217;ve also started to look for the best plan to reach Edinburgh next June.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll fly directly from Mexico City, since I want to visit Paris (in spite of my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.damog.net/20050707/in-finland/">previous and only experience</a> with CDG back in 2005 :-P) and then visit a nice friend in Bilbao. Then I could fly from there to Edinburgh or some place nearby with a cheap flights airline.<br/>
Quick searches throw an estimate of 1&#8217;150 USD for the trip MEX-JFK-CDG-JFK-MEX on Delta. Fortunately, I&#8217;ve started saving already, so I don&#8217;t get pressure on money once DebConf gets closer. I still don&#8217;t know anyway if this could be the best way to travel.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been suggested, also, to travel from Cancún to Madrid through Air Europe, with the cost of ~515&#160;€, which is way more cheap than to fly to Paris, but I should also pay for the transportation from Mexico City to Cancún and from Madrid to Paris, if I really want to visit it, which I do.</p>

<p>Anyway, the cheapest flight I could get directly to Edinburgh is ~1300 USD: MEX-ATL-EDI-ATL-MEX, with Delta too.</p>

<p>Any suggestion on the matter is welcome and appreciated.</p>
