<a href="http://mltplanet.livejournal.com/582.html">Machu</a>, what you posted recently made me recall how some local friends told me were treated upon check-in at Oaxtepec, where DebConf6 was happening. It was maybe four or five persons, including myself, treated with arrogance, indifference and rudeness when there were issues (or say, situations) with the rooms or something, by <em>that</em> Argentinian woman, who was the <em>nice</em> representative of the Orga team with the local venue.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Edited. Only posting bullshit now that I know about after <a href="http://log.damog.net/2008/08/re-when-did-we-start-attacking.html#comments">madduck's reply</a>.
