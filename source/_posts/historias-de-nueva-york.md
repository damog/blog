<p>So, <a href="http://maggit.com.mx" target="_blank">we</a>&#8216;ve finally came up with another personal project we&#8217;ve been working on in the last couple of months: <a href="http://historiasdenuevayork.com" target="_blank">Historias de Nueva York</a>. This is my <a href="http://historiasdenuevayork.com/2008/03/historiasdenuevayorkcom.html" target="_blank">formal introduction</a>. </p>
<p>This (yet another) Spanish spoken blog tells those unheard stories of us, Latinos (and others) immigrants, are experiencing on the Big Apple. Little, funny stories about just everything we see and hear, life experiences and anecdotes waiting to be told, from New York, NY.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it :)Â </p>
