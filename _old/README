Welcome to my blog engine!

You can visit my blog on http://damog.net/blog/

This repository contains all my blog posts ever, dating all the way back to
2002, when I bought my first personal domain and started blogging. It's been
a lot of years, but I have been able to maintain all of the data :)

The blog is currently powered by a very hacked version of Chronicle[1], an
excellent static website generator written in Perl. This repository also
contains everything I use to publish my personal blog. Maybe one day I will
be able to extract a diff of my modifications and offer it to the upstream
author, Steve Kemp[2].

I also want to revamp the design and use a neat, simple and elegant theme,
but that should be some time in the future.

Cheers,
dm.
