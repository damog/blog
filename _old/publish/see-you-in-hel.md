<p>I finally managed my employer to buy my flight ticket to Finland. I will have to pay for it at the end, but the good thing is the company will buy it right now, so I can gradually (and without interests ;-) pay for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight tickets Mexico City - Amsterdam - Helsinki - Amsterdam - Mexico City: $1&#8217;489.00 USD.
</li>
<li>Estimated budget for 15 days in Europe: $1&#8217;000 USD.
