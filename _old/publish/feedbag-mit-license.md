I was contacted by <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> regarding licensing of <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/feedbag">Feedbag</a>. I guess releasing open source software as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a> only makes sense if you continue to live under a rock. I've bumped the version to 0.9 and released it under <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT license</a>.

<a href="http://axiombox.com/feedbag">Feedbag</a> 1.0, which I plan to work on during the following days will bring in a brand new shiny backend powered by <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a>, instead of <a href="http://hpricot.com/">Hpricot</a> (I mean, give me a break, I'm trying to catch up with the Ruby community, after all I'm primarily a Perl guy :D) and hopefully I will be able to recreate most of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090518022508/http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/autodiscovery/">feed auto-discovery test suite</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim_(software_developer)">Mark Pilgrim</a> retired (<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/410GoneThoughtsOnMarkDiveintomarkPilgrimsAndWhysInfosuicides.aspx">410 Gone</a>) when he committed <a href="http://ctmiller.net/2011/10/lets-discuss-infosuicide/">infosuicide</a>.

Have a good weekend!
