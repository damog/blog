I have to congratulate my Venezuelan buddies for making a nice and democratic reelection for President Hugo Chávez, last Sunday. Venezuela confirms again that is a grown, mature and social-oriented country.

Fight continues.

And after Ecuador elections, a couple of weekends ago, more and more social democracy has been made in Latin America, after the win by the leftist Rafael Correa.

Another strap.

We cannot forget neither the Nicaraguan elections in early November where sandinist Daniel Ortega won.

Daniel, the menace.

So sad that Mexico is involved in fraud and without the hope that at least the previous friend countries have.
