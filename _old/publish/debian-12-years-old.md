<p>Happy Birthday, Debian project!<br/><br/>
Did you know the day Debian project was born, Madonna was also born?
And did you know the day the Debian project was born, Elvis Presley
died? Find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_16" target="_blank">more important dates</a>! ;-)<br/><br/>
Thanks to <a href="http://phoenix.lhup.edu/~abrotman/" target="_blank">abrotman</a> who noticed it :-) And well, I have to blog it,
man&#8230; Once upon a time, in #debian-offtopic, I was chatting with my
great native English speaker friend:<br/><br/></p>
<pre>* damog has learnt the Debian's burocracia (I don't know how to spell it in English).
abrotman: wow .. neither do i
* abrotman goes to the dictionary
abrotman: bureaucracy
abrotman: i feel so bad
damog: heh
abrotman: you know .. like bureau ..
abrotman: how fucking sad</pre>
<br/><br/><p>
This made me laugh a lot :-)<br/><br/><br/></p>
