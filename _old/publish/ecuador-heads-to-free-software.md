On his recent (and first) visit to Ecuador, Richard Stallman interviewed with elected president <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Correa">Rafael Correa</a>. Stallman spoke about the benefits and advantages that free software would bring to Correa&#8217;s administration. Some of the Ecuadorian free software community members were present and they <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecualug.org/?q=2006/12/13/correa_stallman_software_libre_en_el_estado">reported</a> that Correa listened to Stallman for like 20 minutes without replying. Then they agreed on freedom issues and had a conversation where they agreed on everything. After that, president Rafael Correa asked his assistants if Ecuador could migrate to free software (on being viable) and they replied that of course, that&#8217;d be a wise choice.

These are, of course, excelent news for Ecuador itself and Latin America! Congratulations <em>yuntas</em>!

Leftist Rafael Correa won on a 2-round election held on Oct 15th and Nov 20th. He will get into office on January 5th. </p>
