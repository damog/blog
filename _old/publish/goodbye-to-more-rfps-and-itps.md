<p>After last week&#8217;s mass bug squash with all of those older than 600
days, I&#8217;ll keep on with the scheduled work, now with RFPs and ITPs
older than 450 days. I&#8217;m doing this by exploring the logs on the
bugs.debian.org tree, so the error margin is now much smaller.</p>
<p>I
received several suggestions last week (the ones from doogie, m2 and
others) that I will take into account with this closing. If you are
curious enough on how I&#8217;m doing this, please take a look into:
