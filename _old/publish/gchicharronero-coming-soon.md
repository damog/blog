<p>Well, I have just built a very little application, inspired by three main things:
</p>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mathomatic.org/">mathomatic</a> which is a wonderful computer algebra system.</li>
<li>The fact that I have always to do this by hand.</li>
<li>The taste of pork :-)

That&#8217;s how I bring to life: <strong>gChicharronero</strong>.

gChicharronero is a little GNOME application to calculate the values of <em>x</em> in a square equation.

I&#8217;m not releasing this because it is still too young and it doesn&#8217;t do much. My idea is to, after A, B and C values are inputted, graph the substitutions on the complete equation and bring results of <em>x</em>. I mean, something nice, something useful, not just some crappy program.

I&#8217;ll release gChicharronero as soon as it:</li>
<li>Handles complex numbers without problems.</li>
<li>Draw the substitutions on the equations.</li>
<li>wishlist: Graph probable values for <em>y = f(x)</em>.

Why the name of gChicharronero? That is because the main formula for solving square equations is called that way by children in Mexico :-)</li>
