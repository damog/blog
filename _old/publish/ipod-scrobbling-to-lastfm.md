<p>Does anybody know of some nice and clean way to send my information on songs played on my iPod (5.5G in my case) to Last.FM? It seems that most of the apps around require iTunes (like iSproggler), but I&#8217;d love to do it with a simple script run on a console (and the iTunesDB propietary binary files happens to be a PITA).</p>

<p>Because of lack of time, if nothing exists on that at the moment, I&#8217;d be glad to offer a bounty for such app.</p>
