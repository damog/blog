<p>Just as Tore said: &#8220;This is the best DebConf ever&#8221;. Isn&#8217;t it great?</p>

<p>I started really enjoying this DebConf once I stopped worrying about bullshit, once I stopped worrying about senseless things and started to really give a shit about almost anything. Why do I have to worry about the DPL giving a shit or not on the Latinamerican Debian community, even after being invited to meet the guys or to attend our BOF? Why do I need to worry about people skinny dipping, since finally it&#8217;s up to them? I started to meet people and to hang on with several old friends and began enjoying the meeting here. Why do I need to worry if people are watching the unpleasant and poorest side of Mexico (bad Internet connections, towns lost in the desert, hookers, rain breaking roofs, etc, etc, etc)? Why do I even have to worry if people get sick or not by drinking water or whatever? I enjoy people here, thanks to all the organization cabal, thanks for your effort and your time on this.</p>

<p>I surely cannot hide my displeasure on some of the things here, but I didn&#8217;t do anything to make it better, obviously, since <strong>I&#8217;m an irresponsible person</strong>.</p>

<p>But after leaving all of this behind, I think <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anaisabel.net/">Ana</a> and me are having a great time sharing time with friends around us (the friends, <em>los cuates</em>, we are here for).</p>
