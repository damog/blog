<p>&#8220;Ruby is an object-oriented programming language developed for the purpose of <u>making programming both enjoyable and fast</u>. With its easy-to-use interpreter, easy-to-understand syntax, complete object-oriented functionality, and powerful class libraries, Ruby has become a language that can be used in a broad range of fields: from text processing and CGI scripts to professional, large-scale programs.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a programmer and a programming-language geek, I know what makes me happy while programming, and I designed Ruby with these elements in mind. I based the language on an object-oriented paradigm, provided a solid feature set (e.g., exceptions, iterators, etc.), and made sure to keep things consistent and balanced. Ruby will help you concentrate on solving problems. It is straightforward and not the least bit enigmatic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my sincere hope that this book will help you enjoy programming in Ruby.</p>

<p>Happy programming!</p>
