I like to read <a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">Planet Perl Iron Man</a>, but since I'm less and less of a user of <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> these days, I prefer to follow interesting feeds on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> instead: I don't have to digest all of the content on my timeline, only when I'm in the mood to see what's going on out there. So, if you wanna follow the account, find it as @<a href="http://twitter.com/perlironman" target="_blank">perlironman</a>. If interested, you can also follow <a href="http://twitter.com/_damog">me</a>. That is all.
