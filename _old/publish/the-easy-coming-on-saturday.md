<p>I don&#8217;t know what happen on weekends. I usually do nothing productive, this blog is one of those things ;-)</p>

<p>Anyway, I made my hackergotchi. I was tedious since I really can&#8217;t handle Gimp in a good way, and I&#8217;m quite a newbie with image processor tools.</p>

<p>So here it is:</p>

<p>This kind of things happen when you don&#8217;t know really what to do, what to think, what to eat, where to go&#8230; Anyway, that pic is like 6 months old, my hair is longer now :-P</p>
