So, <a href="http://gabriellacoleman.org/blog/?p=1293">Biella already posted a reminder</a>, and I'm doing it again on my blog, here.
<pre><code>Attention New York City Debianistas,

The astrological confluence of 1234567890[0], the impending release of
Lenny[1], and the odd sighting of a horned mythical beast that
cryptozoologists are calling a 'new FTP-master-assistant/slave' being
sighted in the mist off the shores of the East River[2] will result in
all emacs users to transcend and all vim users to be transponded to
their respective motherships, which are scheduled for near-orbit on that
night.

You will only be taken if you have a sip of beer on the 13th, before
6:31:30pm at the Pacific Standard[3]. 

If you come late, you may suffer nano for all eternity.

Micah

ps. All nano users will be Left Behind™ to tend to the servers that we
did not bring with us on the Rapture® rickshaw. 

ps. lets keep the the post-apocalyptic space editor battle that will
erupt between the S.S. Church of Emacs, and the H.R.H VIMperator
mothership for later, and drink with revelry together now.
