<a target="_blank" href="http://www.maggit.com.mx">We</a><p>&#8216;ll be attending <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers_(band)">The Killers</a>&#8217; concert tonight. I&#8217;m not completely fan of their synthesized-rock-indie music, but she likes them so much and she made me dig their last album, Sam&#8217;s Town, like a thousand times in the car; so I acceded and bought the tickets online. She was even jelaous of a friend who is also attending, heh :)

I wasn&#8217;t happy at all since they are still a more or less new band, they only have two albums released and prices for tickets were high as hell (ironic), but her surprise smile worth it, it definitively does. ;) </p>
