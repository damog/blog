    	<p>&#8220;Ruby is an object-oriented programming language developed for the purpose of <u>making programming both enjoyable and fast</u>. With its easy-to-use interpreter, easy-to-understand syntax, complete object-oriented functionality, and powerful class libraries, Ruby has become a language that can be used in a broad range of fields: from text processing and CGI scripts to professional, large-scale programs.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a programmer and a programming-language geek, I know what makes me happy while programming, and I designed Ruby with these elements in mind. I based the language on an object-oriented paradigm, provided a solid feature set (e.g., exceptions, iterators, etc.), and made sure to keep things consistent and balanced. Ruby will help you concentrate on solving problems. It is straightforward and not the least bit enigmatic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my sincere hope that this book will help you enjoy programming in Ruby.</p>

<p>Happy programming!</p>

<p>-Yukihiro &#8220;Matz&#8221; Matsumoto, Japan.</p>

    	<p>It&#8217;s extremely weird when sometimes happen what some friends and I lived yesterday. Let me tell you:</p>

<p>We (some friends and I) had a couple of parties to go to. The first one was with my good friend <a href="http://zilus.evolucionlinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Zilus</a>, on a zone called Tecamachalco (which is a little far away from my home, but closer to university). He said pretty ladies were going to be there, as well as good music and environment. So, I decided to go. But before going to pick up my girl, I called Chema (another friend) to see if he had something else. He did.</p>

<p>- Chema: &#8220;Yeah, <em>Promis</em> has a party on Pedregal, one of his friends from work (he, Promis, works on a Starbucks Coffee Station).<br><br>- damog: I have a party on Tecamachalco.<br><br>- Chema: So, it&#8217;s up to you.<br><br>- damog: OK, yeah, I think I prefer to go with you guys, so I&#8217;ll go pick up Raquel and then I&#8217;m on your home.</p>

<p>So, I picked her up, and went to Chema&#8217;s apartment. Promis lives on the same building than Chema, so they were waiting for us (Raq and I) already. So I called them by ringing my car&#8217;s horn. In the meantime, I was talking with Raq:</p>

<p>- damog: I think I don&#8217;t want to go with my car today, what do you think if I leave my car at my house, and hop in the Promis&#8217; car.<br><br>- Raq: Yeah, sounds good to me.</p>

<p>The only problem there was to schedule the return way. So, I asked by phone another friend (Joss) if he could bring us back (Raq and I live very close each other). He accepted. We left my car on my car and went to meet some other friends at Huevo&#8217;s house (Huevo is, of course, his nickname).</p>

<p>At Huevo&#8217;s it was Frijol and Jericó, some other friends. So we were waiting to some other guys and friends, as long as I can remember: Muñeco, Marcial, Barney, Trompiate, Karla and other 5 guys, which I don&#8217;t know very well, I think.</p>

<p>After that, some other friends of friends invited more friends to come to the party. At a certain moment, we arrived, finally, to the house were the party was going to be held, around midnight. We were, surprisingly, around 20 people! I remember Orkut with that: Friends inviting friends to get involved. It was awesome how that can be conformed.</p>

<p>Anyway, all of us were following Promis, which was the contact there. But the things began to become worst: It was not a party, which all of us really thought (we were carrying some bottles of rum, tequila and beer). It was like a very close meeting! And the worst part: A very rude sir opened the door and saw us with a horrible and anger face asking what were we doing there. Promis said we came with Yaqui (apparently, his daughter) to the party.</p>

<p>The father closed the door and went to talk with the girl. After a couple of minutes, she opened the door and let us get in. The house was enormous, with a long yard and even a swimming pool (it is not very common to have a swimming pool in Mexico City) and a bunch of young, bastard and stupid snobs in the yard.</p>

<p>So, we tried to just ignore the fact that most of us were not on the right place, with not the right people and began to drink a little bit, joking around. I have to say that the father was on a balcony watching us every time.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes, more people, around 10 or 15 (our friends of friends) arrived! So we were like 30 or 35 guys, with like a social network!</p>

<p>And finally the moment everyone was thinking it was going to occur, the father told the daughter to tell us to leave. So, we left the house, like if we were like a bunch of criminals. I bet we all are more easy going than the other rich bastards. Besides, we heard that the father was some kind of cop. Corrupt and stupid cop.</p>

<p>Anyway, we went to some other party, in a zone called <em>Las Águilas</em>, which is a zone more familiar, not so snob. But they didn&#8217;t let us get in, because the party was dying already (it was around 1:30 am). So we decided to go Frijol&#8217;s apartment: Around 25 guys.</p>

<p>And we finally died there: Drinking, smoking and having good time with good friends.</p>

<p>The weird thing is the fact that we could get a party and they threw us like trash to the streets :-( Not once: Twice.</p>

<p>Hell.</p>

    	<p>It is not that I work a lot with PHP on Debian, but I really think many people could find a debian-php mailing list useful. That&#8217;s way I filed a Debian bug against lists.debian.org in order to propose the creation of the mailing list. The bug is <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=264069" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you think you could find it useful, please write to <a href="mailto:264069@bugs.debian.org" target="_blank" rel="external">264069@bugs.debian.org</a> telling why. That is how the mailing list is going to be approved.</p>

    	<p></p><p>Yesterday, Friday, I made a test at the university about Calculus and Trigonometry. That test was like an introducing exam at the beginning of the semester to rate our levels of mathematics understanding. So we went to a computer lab to make the exam. The program, called <a href="http://www.aleks.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Aleks</a> is an extremely powerful computer mathematic system, not only for making exams, but for learning mathematics. It runs embedded on a browser, running some kind of Java applets, which is sad.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a JVM from Sun installed on my system (in my last job I needed to have that crap installed), so the Java applets are usually well displayed on the browser. So, I thought I could enter to Aleks system in my laptop, which does not use Windows+IExplorer, like the computing lab from the university where we made the exam.</p>
<p>So, I tried to access, and tried to run the install:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.damog.net/images/aleks.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img border="0" src="http://www.damog.net/images/aleks-thumb.png"></a></p>
<p>That leaves me some encountered feelings:<br></p><p></p>
<li>It is totally insane that the software, running on a browser, does not run cleanly, on my Mozilla Firefox.</li><br><li>It is totally insane that those guys, from Aleks, which is a scientific program, for mathematics, could make it «supported» for Linux.</li><br><li>Anyway, they give a solution for that problem.<br><br>So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what to think :-| That is the problem ever and ever. Should I blame the guys from Aleks? Should I blame the guys from the Mathematics department from university for choosing that? Or my teachers from Electronic Engineering for doing what the last guys told them to do? The university&#8217;s principal?<br><br>Anyway, Aleks is nice. It has plenty things to work with, it has excellent programs for graphics, functions, etc.</li>

    	<p></p><p>I have received a couple of questions regarding of my use of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">LiveJournal</a> instead of any other weblog system. It&#8217;s quite easy.</p>
<p>LiveJournal is a free software company, using free software to build a business. That&#8217;s widely cool, they are not the same kind of company that allows you to store a webservice and then gets yourself deep on spam. That&#8217;s ethic.</p>
<p>But, why am I using LiveJournal web service instead of <a href="http://jaws.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">jaws</a>, *Nuke or other web logs? Because I&#8217;m lazy to maintain a web site for my own. That&#8217;s well shown on damog.net cover page ;-)</p>
<p>I installed jaws some days ago, <a href="http://www.damog.net/blog" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. I like it, but not too much, I really prefer to have something that I like the most, not just use because it was developed in Mexico, or by some friends: That&#8217;s the truth. I don&#8217;t like it to be so related to some stuff that nobody cares, but the developers (MVC, ERP, SOAP, etc, etc, etc&#8230;). It&#8217;s obviously a personal opinion.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, I installed also <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mambo</a> to use it more like a organization framework, <a href="http://mambo.damog.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. It is extremely beautiful, those guys from graphic design rock, exploding lots of great features of JavaScript and web development.</p>
<p>Any way, I just changed the layout of my LiveJournal&#8217;s weblog. I like it, as I did with <a href="http://www.live365.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Live365</a>, I would probably buy a paid account, to support a little bit. What they say in their Paid Accounts page is a thought I really share:<br></p><p></p>
<p><pre>Do I have to pay for using LiveJournal services?<br>No, of course not. Paying for web services is annoying, we agree.<br>That’s why nearly all of LiveJournal’s functionality is available<br>free of charge. However, if you’re happy with the service you’re<br>being provided, show your support and get a paid account.</pre></p>
<p></p><p><br>So, why not? At least, at the end of month, when I receive my check from work ;-)<br></p><br><strong>Current Mood:</strong> <img width="15" height="15" src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/growf/smileys/high.gif"> high<br><strong>Current Music:</strong> You&#8217;re listening to - Kyoku Radio<p></p>

    	<p>Well, today was my 20th birthday. It was pretty nice all the weekend.</p>

<p>On Friday 6th, some friends, my lady and I went to Xochimilco&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.xochimilco.df.gob.mx/turismo/trajineras.html" target="_blank" rel="external">trajineras</a></em>. For my surprise, it was the birthday of some other guy, so he had priority on partying about birthdays ;-)</p>

<p>Yesterday, we were planning to go to a cantina which we used to go often in the past, <em>Cantina La México</em>. So, I invited some friends. We arrived there and it was empty. A couple of persons inside the bar, so it was awful. So, Joss (a friend) and his girl friends proposed to go to some other place. So we went to Ihú (not very sure if it is some kind of discotheque or so), but we were there all night long.</p>

<p>And today, my official birthday my parents, sister and I went to eat together. Then, we went back to home, and spent the noon watching TV.</p>

<p>I think it was pretty cool. Tomorrow it starts the next semester at school. I should go to sleep and have rest&#8230; or not. ;-)</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you who said «Congratulations» to me today: You really know who you are and I really appreciate you all.</p>

    	<p>I&#8217;ve been working on several things recently.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/dcc" target="_blank" rel="external">dcontrol</a> was requested to change its unix name from dcc to another, since <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-dcc" target="_blank" rel="external">pkg-dcc</a> got uncomfortable about the similarity of both names. We agree, and we are now changing to <em>debcontrol</em>.</p>

<p>* We are migrating files from the old school system we were using at the university into the new one: The one I&#8217;m developing with the other freak guys from the office :-) This is not as easy as it could be thought and I&#8217;m trying to code the script on Ruby. Basically, it has to do these things:<br><br>- Put the old files on the correct places.<br><br>- Generate an SQL scheme for each file.<br><br>- Drop every scheme on PostgreSQL.<br><br>- Code an PHP script to check, when the user logs in the system, if their files were migrated with a 0 status code.</p>

<p>* The other thing I&#8217;m doing at work now is the administration of a web system called <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Moodle</a> (package <a href="http://packages.debian.org/moodle" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>). Moodle is a huge example that good apps can be coded in PHP. Moodle is a virtual learning environment, usually used at school centers, universities, etc. I&#8217;m getting in charge of administering a couple of courses of religious stuff (yes, although I don&#8217;t consider myself a religious person, I&#8217;m enrolled on a school with certain tendency to it -It&#8217;s not very, very bad, at least, the huge amount of money that students pay are destined to something useful-). I do not teach the courses, of course, I&#8217;m just controlling everything :-) So, if I&#8217;m getting paid for using free software (Moodle is licensed under GPL), the least I can do is contribute to the project, so I&#8217;m helping with upstream project: For example, there are still some strings not translated to Spanish, so I translate them -it both helps me on my job, and also to the project-; and stuff like that.</p>

<p>* I&#8217;m getting back to school, with some new course name called Computing and Electronic Engineering, which is more inclined to my professional profile. I&#8217;m getting back to school, on Monday 9th.</p>

<p>* My birthday, as I said in the previous post, is coming a day before school: I&#8217;m getting 20 on 8th. I&#8217;m leaving the <em>1X</em> years, and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s kind of sad. When I was a child I always thought how I would be at 2000 year, almost 5 years ago, I realize that I was 16, and nothing special happened :-) But now, I&#8217;m getting 20, probably the perfect age for leaving home and trying to make myself a little bit more free.</p>

<p>* I have two more packages on the Debian queue, that makes me happy: One was already rejected from ftpmaster like two weeks ago: We (my sponsor and I) had a little glitch on the Architecture: field of the package. One package is a library: libgtk-trayicon-ruby, and the other is a nice logger for physical activities (I&#8217;m geek! I do not sport but hack about sporting, ;-).</p>

<p>Everything seems to be nice and calmed by now. I would like to be just like this every day on my life, because it even gives me time to write all this crap :-)</p>
