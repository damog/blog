    	<p>July 31st was my last day working for Sixbell-Nekotec Solutions (formerly known as Nekotec Tecnología). I lasted there three years. It seems like a life was spent there, heh: I entered after turning 20 and I’m leaving some days before I turn 23.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.maggit.com.mx/" target="_blank">Our</a> future is still a bit fuzzy, but we are working on it. In the meantime, I’m getting back full-time to <a href="http://www.matematicas.unam.mx/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> next 13rd. But if our plans succeed and if everything goes right, we’ll be moving by the end of August or early September. Heh, yes, leaving school temporarily, again!</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m unemployed right now. <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/damog" target="_blank">Listening</a> to music most part of the day, taking Raquel to work, coding a bit here, there, doing some Debian labor, etc.</p>

<p>Meh.</p>

<p>An End Has A Start is one of the albums by the English band, The Editors, it makes a great title for my post now :-). I just listened to Taraf de Haïdouks’ Maskarada, it’s not that great as the masterpiece as The Continuing Adventures. I’m getting addicted to the Cold War Kids.</p>

    	<p>You really have to be a fucking son of a bitch for living in a world where you go out and see everyday’s people living on extreme poorness, unfairness all over the place, six year-olds performing like clowns on red stops and your fellow compatriots dying on the streets, among hundreds of all other kinds of shit happening. You really have to be one when, after all of that, you finally arrive and seat on your so comfortable chair and start blogging, working with free software or playing a movie on your iPod.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>So, my official training for DebConf8 has just started!</p>

<p>What is this training about? Well, since a couple of weeks ago, I had seen a little Argentinian restaurant two blocks from my place. It is not new to find Argentinian places on the area, specially on La Condesa, where lots of foreigns reside within Mexico City. Argentinians are known in some circles, because they usually take their dogs for walking on Parque España, Parque México and the neighborhoods nearby (not that Mexicans don’t walk dogs, it’s just a bit more stereotyped for Mexicans to put dogs on the roofs of buildings and not taking very good care of them). Anyway, since I live on Roma Sur, which is just crossing Insurgentes avenue away from La Condesa, it is also a crowded neighborhood (which is more like a family-kind area), the nearest Argentinian place was this, Che Charrúa.</p>

<p>I had no idea where I could have a nice cheap lunch, so I headed there. The prices were not nuts, but it wasn’t cheap as eating in the street, of course. Che Charrúa is a small place, they have like five tables inside, and two or three outside on the sidewalk. I ordered a Bahía Blanca meal, which was basically, three empanadas (you could choose between ham and cheese, meat, chicken and corn/cheese), a couple of cups of fresh water and a dessert flan (which name I just can’t remember, but it was Argentinian typical). The Mexican part couldn’t be left aside, that’s why they offer chimichurri or spicy sauce :) Besides, they give jamaica-water (which is some kind of juice of a Mexican flower, which is delicious, DebConfers could probably had some on DC6, I bet you can only find it here). At the end, I ordered a black-chocolate alfajor, which was extremely delicious, but cold, since it was on the fridge.</p>

<p>So, that’s my training: Getting ready for DC8/Argentinian food! After a quick chat with ASCIIGirl, I’ve decided to take this a bit further, I’ll be going to Che Charrúa or other .ar restaurants, at least once every two/three weeks and have something different each time, take pictures of places/dishes, etc. My official Argentinian food training! Who joins the challenge?</p>

    	<p>Yeah, we are almost two weeks back now, but until now I can feel we are done with lots of pending issues.<br></p><br><p><br>To summarize, I left <a href="http://debconf7.debconf.org/" target="_blank">DebConf</a> on Saturday morning, arrived NYC on the afternoon where Raquel was waiting for me. By Sunday, we had the very nice chance to meet with <a href="http://damog.net/files/pics/abrotman-cakebutt.jpg" target="_blank">abrotman</a>, rcox and <a href="http://vireo.org/%7Estew/blog" target="_blank">stew</a>. We stayed at stew and rcox’s place until Tuesday, when we got back. We also had the chance to meet with people that we have been working for remotely.<br><br>We were walking around in NYC, and suddenly, the 5th avenue became multicolor. It was the gay pride parade. You can take a look at the pics on the <a href="http://damog.net/gallery" target="_blank">gallery</a>, lots of gay people. Our visit to NYC was pretty gayish actually, since we spent our first night in Chelsea, presenced an electronic music festival or similar for lesbians, and the next day, first row on the parade :-)<br></p><br><p align="left">And that’s it, since we came back until like yesterday, life was a mess; lots of work pending to deliver and many other issues. Finally, we are right now settled up again, enjoying a cold rainy nice weather in Mexico City with <a href="http://damog.net/files/pics/victoria.jpg" target="_blank">very cheap beer</a> (compared with UK pints!) and loved people :-)</p><br><p><br>Thanks to all who made such a wonderful DebConf, even that, in my case, I arrived late and left early, it was just great (thanks also to MJ Ray, specially; and also to all people who was worried about my arrival, you know who you are, thanks). Thanks also to Mike and Rachel who hosted us, they are a very nice couple. And also, thanks to Alex who joined us in NYC, coming from Philadelphia, spent a nice day with us, took us to Chinatown and Little Italy and gave me a Phillies baseball cap (just as exchange of the worldwide famous <a href="http://damog.net/files/pics/abrotman.jpg" target="_blank">umbrella hat</a>). </p>

    	<p>So, yeah, I’m in Edinburgh right now. For those of you who have asked, here is a little track of my adventures in the previous days:<br></p><br><ul><br><li>Saturday morning. I leave my apartment in Mexico City at around 4:30 am. Raquel takes me to the airport. We both realize how we could not work properly without each other.</li><br><li>Saturday, 1&#160;pm. Arriving in New York City. Given the time and the stupidly long line for passport/visa control, I drop my plans of visiting the city.</li><br><li>Saturday, 3&#160;pm. After getting used to the AirTrain at JFK, I finally find Terminal 4, in order to check whether FlyGlobeSpan is really there. I realize that screen in the terminal announce my flight as cancelled.</li><br><li>Saturday 5&#160;pm. We receive an explanation, that the company representing the airline in the airport did not receive the proper aircraft (!), so the flight was cancelled. We all get accommodation at the DoubleTree hotel near the airport. I blame and say bad words about the situation. My flight was being rescheduled to Sunday or Monday, upon availability.</li><br><li>Saturday 6:30&#160;pm. I was chatting with my people from the hotel room. I really love wifi.</li><br><li>Saturday 7&#160;pm. I take the hotel shuttle to get to the AirTrain and then get to the subway system in New York.</li><br><li>Saturday 8:30&#160;pm. Getting to Chambers St. in Little Italy, Manhattan. Walk a few blocks and have some pizza with some latinos. Realizing that they also sell pirate DVDs in NY’s metro and pirate lenses and hats on street markets. Have my first Budweiser.</li><br><li>Saturday, 9&#160;pm. After calling Raquel, I realize the time and in order to not miss time or whatever and given how tired I was, I decide to go back. I go up the subway on Essex station.</li><br><li>Saturday 11:30&#160;pm. On my way to Jamaica Station, which connecs to the AirTrain, they took us out of the train because it was their last stop (missing like 5 stations to get to the real last one). We get on a free shuttle. While waiting for it, I realize that most of the people there are Caribbeans and Mexicans, most people speak Spanish or a Caribbean English. Get on the shuttle. A black lady gets on and start telling Jesus is coming and we are all sinners, she gives people flyers on the holy things and the evil things. People (specially youngs, wearing sportswear) make fun at her, I only feel sorry. A latina rubbs a latino’s arms and admires his tattoos (both complete strangers that eventually met on the shuttle), while being invited to their party. Just as I said to Biella, it’s a bit outstanding to me since it’s the first time I’m in NYC and happen to be real what neighborhoods seem in the movies :-)</li><br><li>Saturday, 12:30&#160;pm. Finally got to the hotel, after being waiting for a taxi in some terminal at JFK. The hotel shuttle showed up and they brought me there.</li><br><li>Sunday, 11:00 am. I get a phone call from the reception hotel saying that checkout time is at 12. Hurry to shower, do some stuff and look for some other flights. I find a good price for a flight from NYC to Dublin, for that same day. Consider it, talk to Raquel about it and try to buy it. Not possible, my credit card is denied for some reason. Take the shuttle to the airport.</li><br><li>Sunday, 1:00&#160;pm. The AerLingus ticket sales are opened until 2:30&#160;pm (what kind of timetable is that?).

    	<p>So, here I am in Jamaica, NY, near the JFK airport. Flyglobspan’s flight to Liverpool was cancelled and scheduled until next Monday. This simply sucks and I don’t have any energy left for flaming anybody, I just did it too much during the afternoon. Just as <a href="http://frisia.middle-earth.us/2007/06/10/and-straight-on-til-morning/" target="_blank">Christine</a>, I shouldn’t have booked with this crappy company, due to my <a href="http://www.damog.net/20070504/to-edinburgh/" target="_blank">previous feelings about this</a>. A lady was flying on Tuesday, and they rescheduled her itinerary to today, and they simply re-rescheduled now for Monday.</p>

<p>Also, I already had an scheduled train from Liverpool to Edinburgh and an open return. If I don’t get my way to the UK on Monday, I’ll simply won’t be able to make it for DebConf, since I had planned to get back from Edinburgh to Liverpool on Friday night or Saturday morning, Raquel could join me in NYC before of what we had planned (Saturday evening).</p>

<p>At least, the airline is paying for a hotel. So, I’m stuck here, with two bottles of tequila, one of mezcal, a bottle of extra-spicy Valentina, a pack of pingüinitos, which all were presents for buddies, and all energy I wanted to spend with friends in Edinburgh. Such is life.</p>

<p>I’m going out right now actually. I’ll see if I can catch some jazz somewhere in NYC. If any Debianer or Perler is around the neighborhood, feel free to call/text to +525529009939.</p>
