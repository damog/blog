<p>And since I already missed friday and today, monday, of school, it would be unforgivable to miss tomorrow too.</p>

    	<p></p><p>So, as I already <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.livejournal.com/users/damog/12483.html" target="_blank" rel="external">wrote</a> before, Dalai Lama was in Mexico for the last week, and on thrusday he was at college receiving an Honoris Causa Doctorate by the UIA-ITESO educational system. Funny guy.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to get into the main auditorium.<br></p><p></p>
<li>A complete security system was installed in the university. Metal scanners were a PITA.</li><br><li>Invitation was required, a la Orkut. <img alt="tongue.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/tongue.png"><br><br>Anyway, we could watch the event by video conference broadcasted by the university over the Internet.<br><br>So, I can’t remember really how I got into a very interesting “belief” quiz.<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Belief-o-Matic</a> is a quiz for telling you what really religion you believe in. I really consider myself as everything but religious person, so I decided to go through the quiz.<br><br>Finally, the system told me I was a Mahayana Buddhist <img alt="bigsmile.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/bigsmile.png">, which I don’t know what that really means <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"> There are lots of religions, some that many of you may never heard, like Neo Pagans, lol.<br><br>Anyway I don’t think I’m a complete Mahayana guy since they are more likely to be against things like abortion or homosexuals, which tend to be a very conservative stuff. According to BeliefNet, some of the occidental buddhist tend to accept that, although it is not well seen from oriental buddhists.<br><br>So, what religion, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html" target="_blank" rel="external">according to Belief-o-matic</a> are you? <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"><br></li>

    	<p>Today I have been atacked by a flu. I hate the sore throat, the body pain, headache, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, today it was my sister’s birthday. She is 25 now, and to bother her I tell her, she is a quater of century years old, sounds older <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"> I gave her a nice tiny blue sweater as present. Anyway, sweaters are cheaper on summer <img alt="smile.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

<p>I hope this weekend the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://debcontrol.alioth.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">dcontrol team</a> will be launching a survey for Debian users. I have been thinking on it. I don’t want to send the announce mail of it to only <a href="mailto:debian-user_at_lists_dot_debian_dot_org" target="_blank" rel="external">debian-user mailing list</a>. It would be nice to have translations, in order to allow any kind of user to answer it, because that is whay we are looking for in Debian Desktop: Make life easier and nicer <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"> So, we could probably translate the survey strings to Spanish, French, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese (remember, they like to do anything like pt_BR way), German, etc, etc, etc. So, if you are interested on helping us to translate into your language, please <a href="mailto:damog_at_damog_dot_net" target="_blank" rel="external">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>I think that’s it for today. I’m really in pain <img alt="sad.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/sad.png"></p>

    	<p>Today, I bought a couple of .mx domains, since they are on some kind of special offer, quite cheap.</p>

<p>The interesting domain I bought was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://debian.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">debian.com.mx</a> which will point, at least now, to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.debianmexico.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Debian MÃ©xico</a> project. I’m hoping to get <em>debian.net.mx</em> once, but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.nic.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">NIC MX</a> is in general a bad service.</p>

<p>I’ll somewhat busy in the next few days, mainly because of an AutoCAD project that I have to deliver tomorrow, and a physics exam some day, don’t know yet the exact date. Besides, I’ve plenty things to do.</p>

<p>And, BTW, I have changed some of the main pictures of the website. Some of them are incredibly cute <sup>_</sup></p>

    	<p>I recently noticed that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cartoon Network</a>, one of my beloved TV channels, will (or is already) launch a new cartoon concept. At least, new for them.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/gen/asfaq/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Adult Swim</a> is a block where they are broadcasting some cartoon <em>for adults</em>. They argue about the age of their audience, saying that more grown and mature people watch CN. That’s way, in a night block (from 11&#160;pm to 5 am) they are showing cartoon series such as Family Guy and Futurama, both <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.fox.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Fox</a> superhits, and some others like The Ripping Friends, a very nice show of ‘bad boys’ that I had the chance to watch once and Lupin The 3rd, which is the story of a thief.</p>

<p>I don’t really know if that would benefit CN or not. CN has been consolidated as a great cartoon maker, noted on Cartoon Cartoons, and broadcasting some old school shows. Because of that is the excellent audience they have now, including adult people. Now, it is probably some kind of mistake to change their shows because of that. If something is being successful between everybody, why change it?</p>

<p>So, I really don’t know if that is going to be broadcasted on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cartoon Network Latin America</a>, since LA population and probably audience tend to be more conservative. I hope Adult Swim reachs Mexico, at least.</p>

    	<p></p><p>I’m finally back in town. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://fsl.glo.org.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">Festival de Software Libre</a> was pretty cool, although, I couldn’t find a real [and usable] access point for my connection needs <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"></p>
<p>Some great things happened.<br></p><p></p>
<li><br><strong>Day 1, tuesday</strong>. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://blog.tacvbo.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tacvbo</a> and I arrived Guadalajara around 7:15&#160;pm and wait for someone to pick us up for more than one hour. Finally, a very funny guy, Bernardo, picked us up. We went to the hotel, and then to have dinner with him, and two other guys.We had a nice dinner talking mainly about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Debian</a> or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.gentoo.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gentoo</a> <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png">. I tried a very nice pozole with chicken, it rocked.<br><br>As it was a little bit late, we went to the hotel again. Tacvbo worked a few minutes more on his presentation, and we finally felt down sleeping.</li><br><li><br><strong>Day 2, wednesday</strong>. Odin and Fermin came from Mexico City early in the morning. We all went to have some <em>tortas ahogadas</em> <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png">. And finally, we went to the Festival.There I met the very nice Patux, one of the main organizators of the event, and well, the event was pretty cool, the opening ceremony, the IBM talk, the Gentoo talk (given by Tacvbo), but specially the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.unix-power.net/amnesiac/docs/ruby.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Programming Elements on Ruby</a>, by my very good friend <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.unix-power.net/amnesiac" target="_blank" rel="external">Amnesiac</a>.<br><br>At night, we went to drink some beers, on a catina-style taqueria. There we met some other guys from the Festival, to my surprise, we found there <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://kad.gulags.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kad</a>, which is a very good friend from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://jaws-project.sf.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jaws</a> development <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://planet.jaws.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">team</a>.</li><br><li><br><strong>Day 3, thursday</strong>. A little bit of hangover. I woke up, toke a shower, woke up the other guys and received a phone call. It was Sandra, a very nice friend from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://yahoogroups.com/Godmakers" target="_blank" rel="external">Godmakers</a> mailing list. So we went to take a quick breakfast while the others decided to get themselves ready.I came back to the room, and as usual, Tacvbo was not ready. We were in our way to FSL around 10:30. My talk was at 11, so we arrived on time.<br><br>Giving my talk I realized the presence of one of the persons that made me happier to meet, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.kublun.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wieland</a>. He was there only for a few minutes, but I was greatly happy with him going to see a part of my talk, which by the way, was fine.<br><br>So, he was there until I finished my talk, hang on with me and other guys and finially left to his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.iteso.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">school</a>.<br><br>Then, we (Amnesiac, Tacvbo, Odin, Fermin and me) went to this sushi buffet that Amnesiac likes, it rocks, lots of variety of sushi :). Then, I took a taxi and went to the bus station, in my way home.<br><br>I can conclude that Guadalajara is a great city. Lots of <strong>pretty</strong> women there, nice hot weather, nice kindly people. But probably too heaven for me. I need more like a hell city, which finally I just got again. What am I going to do? <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"><br></li>

    	<p></p><p>I have received several comments on why am I writing my blog in English, since many of the Mexican guys involved on free software who own a blog and use to blog periodicly, don’t. Obviously I had to talk about this some time because it is not usual.<br></p><p></p>
<ul><br><li><br><strong>i18n</strong>. Do you really do not understand English? Or probably <em>my</em> English? If you do, who cares?</li><br><li><br><strong>Reach</strong>.

    	<p>Isn’t it annoying  to syndicate a feed, any kind (RSS, RDF, OPML, Atom) and the new is only a few lines long? It is not the entire blog entry, only a few words. I hate that, it makes you decide between:<br></p><br><ol><br><li>Get the RSS reader to the Trash bin and visit the website.</li><br><li>Piss off the coder of the feed.</li><br></ol><br><p><br>If I’m using a reader, I obviously will prefer the second option. So, why would I be using a damn feed reader? </p>

    	<p></p><p>This incoming week will be madness. Two main things will happen.</p>
<p>I’m giving a talk at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://fsl.glo.org.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">Festival de Software Libre</a> in Gualadajara, on thrusday. It will be about colaboration in free software projects, focused on Debian.</p>
<p>The other important thing to do is a physics exam on Friday, so it will be madness to cover both things, and try to not lose more classes than the ones I will, so this is my plan:<br></p><p></p>
<li><br><strong>Monday 27 th.</strong><br>I have to finish a homework for Tuesday, and it is long. I only have one day left for deliver it, so the entire day I have to work on it.</li><br><li><br><strong>Tuesday 28 th.</strong><br>Deliver my homework at 9 am, hopefully finished. Stay on that class until the end (around 11 am). Go the office (FYI I work in the university, so the office is pretty close from the classroom) and pick up my stuff (I’ve already informed I was missing almost the entire week).<br><br>Get on the bus with Tacvbo at 12:30&#160;pm. Then we’d spend 7/8 hours within the bus until we reach Guadalajara.</li><br><li><br><strong>Wednesday 29 th.</strong><br>Watch Tacvbo’s talk about Gentoo and scream about its disadvantages <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png">. The entire day, I would spend it finishing my presentation.</li><br><li><br><strong>Thrusday 30 th.</strong><br>Give my talk at 11 am. Eat lunch at midday. Take a bus around 4&#160;pm in order to return to Mexico City. In the meantime, being in the bus, I <strong>have</strong> to study physics for my exam, that will be the only moment alone where I’m going to be able to study. Arriving estimated time: Midnight.</li><br><li><br><strong>Friday 1st Oct.</strong><br>Wake up at 6 am for my Calculus class at 7, and my Physics exam at 9. Then I would go to work. Then, go to eat and spend the noon with Rachel.<br><br>That’s it. That is evil plan for this week. I hope I could post activities everyday. See ya!</li>
