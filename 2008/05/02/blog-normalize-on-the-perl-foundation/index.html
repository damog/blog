    	<p>So I wrote an entry on my tumblelog about what&#8217;s going on with my life currently. Since Tumblr&#8217;s feed doesn&#8217;t get pushed immediately, I showed the post to my co-worker and friend Chris, before it hit the planets:</p><br><p>- So, yeah I have my blog since it&#8217;s syndicated on <a href="http://planet.debian.org" target="_blank">Planet Debian</a> and other small feed aggregators -I said. </p><br><p>- But do they really care about your bike, your chess games or you attending that conference? -he asked-, I mean, I <i>do</i> care, but people?</p><br><p>- Well -I replied after a quick thought-, I think that&#8217;s how personal blogs work.</p><br><p>After a deeper thought I just realized that indeed no one cares and deleted the entry before it was pushed to the feed, updating it on FeedBurner, etc. It was a nice awakening.</p><br><hr><br><p>But on a bit more interesting (for people) things, <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Perl Foundation</a> is currently requesting comments on <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/05/2008q2_grant_proposals.html" target="_blank">the projects they received for grant requests</a>. My proposal is there, &#8220;Solidifying and Extending the Blog Normalize project&#8221;. I do think there are some other more deeper projects, of course, but I think B::N is also an interesting one and the amount requested is not as big for other projects, so it&#8217;d be nice to give it a try. </p><br><p>I believe B::N is a good idea that could be enhanced nicely. I proposed the idea to the <a href="http://textmotion.org/" target="_blank">TextMotion</a> developers yesterday on IRC (since that&#8217;s one of the CMS there would be a connector for -as of the grant proposal-). After deeper discussion, CMSs will not make translators for a lot of projects into theirs, but B::N would, so maybe we could make some sort of webservice that CMSs could call on their installation phases. That, or the user at the end could actually do the conversion himself locally.</p><br><p>Having the proper information, one could be able to get from TextMotion to <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>, to <a href="http://blogger.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a>, to <a href="http://joomla.org" target="_blank">Joomla</a>, to <a href="http://tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="_blank">MovableType</a> and to TextMotion again, making a transparent circular transformation.</p><br><p>Some of this is currently possible with the few code I&#8217;ve written for it, currently in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~damog/Blog-Normalize-0.0rc2/lib/Blog/Normalize.pm" target="_blank">CPAN</a> (and a bit deeper proof of concept); if you are interested, please <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/05/2008q2_grant_proposal_solidify.html" target="_blank">leave your comments</a> on the Perl Foundation blog entry. And review others too. At the end, I might end up doing the project myself, but if some money is granted to do so, why not apply to it, that&#8217;d just speed it up. </p>
