    	<p>Just as lots of people I know, in December I bought a PowerBook (yes, I know, don&#8217;t bitch me about the new MacBook Pro). It&#8217;s a 5,6 actually. The day I bought it, I brought it to work and installed Sarge on it. After a while, I installed MacOS when, from the inside, it started to make a slightly hearable beep on random intervals. Suddenly, I figgured out that the installation went completely slow (it took about 4 hours to install MacOS). It was a Monday. I thought that wouldn&#8217;t be a permanent problem since it used to be quiet for some times. On thursday that beep and the slowness became nuts. On Friday morning I had tons of work so I wasn&#8217;t able to take it to the Apple service, besides I thought I could have it with me on the weekend since I was doing some work on Wikipedia. On the weekend, I checked the Apple forums and found out that some people used to have the same problem and it was the hard disk drive the one causing troubles. &#8220;Alright, I can take it to the Apple center on Monday&#8221;. Monday. December 12nd, Our Lady of Guadalupe holiday, the fucking lazy bastards went on half-day off on the Apple service center. Motherfuckers, one more day. Tuesday. &#8220;Here it is, it has these problems, and I found that it is the hard disk drive&#8221;. &#8220;Right, we&#8217;ll check it, give us a call on Thrusday&#8221;. Thrusday. &#8220;Yeah? This is David Moreno, I took my PowerBook with you guys, my reference ID is X&#8221;. &#8220;Ah&#8230; The PowerBook?&#8221;. &#8220;Yeah?&#8221;. &#8220;A 15-inch G4 PowerBook?&#8221;. &#8220;Yes&#8221;. &#8220;Ah&#8230; well&#8230; Uhm&#8230; We&#8217;re still on it&#8221;. Fucking assholes, lazy bastards, hijos de la chingada,  they haven&#8217;t even checked it. &#8220;Give us a call tomorrow, please&#8221;. Bastards. I was too busy on Friday, since Ana was in Mexico City, to remember (or even care, being with Ana <img border="0" alt="Tongue out" src="mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif"> ) calling them. So, it was until Monday 19th. &#8221;Hello? Remember me? I want to know the status of my PowerBook, my reference ID is X&#8221;. &#8220;Yeah, we have already checked it, and the problem is not on the hard disk drive, the thing causing problems is the Super Drive&#8221;. &#8220;Huh?&#8221;. &#8220;Yeah, we will request a new Super Drive to the Monterrey office and change it, please give us a call in a couple of days&#8221;. Fucking assholes! They stopped working half week because of Christmas. I called them on Wednesday 4th. &#8220;Sure! You can come and pick it up, it&#8217;s ready since before New Years&#8221;. Stupid. I started playing with my computer again and apparently, it was fixed! No problems any more that I could try to reproduce before. Last Friday, 6th, my buddies and I went to Guadalajara for a nice weekend. Yesterday, Monday, the computer started to fail again, with the same bloody problem. Today, I took it to the Apple service, again, with the same stupid fucking asshole shitty technic (my bullocks) guy. The MacOS Disk Utility now was warning about possible data loss and the hard disk drive going into shit. At least, that stupid couldn&#8217;t say it was anything else. Wearing a nice-person mask, I arrive today to the Apple service: &#8220;Hello, remember me? My PowerBook is still with problems&#8221;. &#8220;What did we do to it?&#8221;. Asshole. &#8220;You changed the Super Drive apparently since it was the one causing problems&#8221;. Now his face changed like saying &#8220;Geez, what am I gonna do now&#8230;&#8221;. &#8220;I want you to change my hard disk drive since now the installer is complaining since the partitions are all shit and cannot be recognized and&#8230;&#8221;. &#8220;Right, I will ask for the hard disk drive to the local office now and your computer should be OK by tomorrow noon&#8221;. How fucking things can change, can&#8217;t they? Fucking asshole. &#8220;Thanks, I&#8217;ll be here tomorrow noon&#8221;.  <img border="0" alt="Yell" src="mambots/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-yell.gif"> I want my computer back! <br><br></p>
