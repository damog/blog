      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a Rails application for the microblogging strategy for Debian (which I used to call, debian-twitter, but you know how us Debian folks are :D). I came up with a strange issue, that at first I thought was ActionController&amp;rsquo;s fault or some crap.
So, I was testing one of my controllers with something like this:
cat /tmp/mm.txt | curl -d @- http://localhost:3000/message/new  /tmp/mm.txt is a PGP signed message which then I just send as POST data to my application.</description>

      <description>I have a couple of accounts in Twitter (namely @debian and @planetalinux) that are starting to bring a lot of followers (well, at least some of them). And given that I consider these accounts to be Twitter-polite enough, I like to follow the followers back too; however, this task sometimes gets really hard and it&amp;rsquo;s tiring to go through the followers pages and follow those that I don&amp;rsquo;t follow yet over and over.</description>
