      <description>I am a huge fan of LinkedIn, I love it. Handled properly, it can allow you to establish great opportunities that eventually lead up to either work or paid gigs and we all know how good money is, right? I have spent time for the last couple of weeks making sure my own LinkedIn profile is complete, fully up-to-date and that I&amp;rsquo;m taking full advantage of all the features that the site has to offer, and even though I&amp;rsquo;m not actively looking for a job it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to get contacted by other developers or directors (heck, even recruiters) inviting you to consider other job opportunities.</description>
