      <description>A year ago today, I started working for Booking.com. I wish I could say that the time has flown by, but it really hasn&amp;rsquo;t. It has been one hell of a ride on all fronts: work, learning experiences, friends, but specially at home, since working for this company didn&amp;rsquo;t come without a complete life change. So far so good, and for that I&amp;rsquo;m grateful :)</description>

      <description>I started working for Booking.com two weeks ago now. These last two months have been probably the most chaotic and hectic in a long time from what I remember in my life. I left New York City, chilled out in Mexico City for several weeks and then finally relocated to beautiful Amsterdam. The decision of leaving New York was not simple, but I decided to take on new challenges, one cycle had ended for me and it was time for me to move on.</description>
