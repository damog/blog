      <description>Recently, my BFF Wadita (here watching the horizon) moved to Vancouver, BC from Mexico City to continue his studies on 3D animation. In the last months he was producing a short film for his personal portfolio which was finally released: it&amp;rsquo;s called The Last Day. Even though (as he described it himself) it&amp;rsquo;s not Pixar-like animation, I really enjoyed it, it&amp;rsquo;s both melancholic and inspiring.

You can go to the film website and watch it on high and low quality with a bunch of neat resources.</description>
