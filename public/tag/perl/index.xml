      <title>Webhook Setup with Facebook::Messenger::Bot</title>
      <link>https://damog.net/blog/2016/08/29/webhook-setup-with-facebookmessengerbot/</link>

      <description>The documentation for the Facebook Messenger API points out how to setup your initial bot webhook. I just committed a quick patch that would make it very easy to setup a quick script to get it done using the unreleased and still in progress Perl&amp;rsquo;s Facebook::Messenger::Bot:
use Facebook::Messenger::Bot; use constant VERIFY_TOKEN =&amp;gt; &#39;imsosecret&#39;; my $bot = Facebook::Messenger::Bot-&amp;gt;new(); # no config specified! $bot-&amp;gt;expect_verify_token( VERIFY_TOKEN ); $bot-&amp;gt;spin();  This should get you sorted.</description>

      <title>WIP: Perl bindings for Facebook Messenger</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I started looking into wrapping the Facebook Messenger API into Perl. Since all the calls are extremely simple using a REST API, I thought it could be easier and simpler even, to provide a small framework to hook bots using PSGI/Plack.
So I started putting some things together and with a very simple interface you could do a lot:
use strict; use warnings; use Facebook::Messenger::Bot; my $bot = Facebook::Messenger::Bot-&amp;gt;new({ access_token =&amp;gt; &#39;.</description>

      <description>I just booked my train tickets for FOSDEM 2014. Accommodation will be sorted out later.
This year I planned it well in advance to get decent prices for Thalys, unlike last year that we ended up riding the slow trains that stop in every single town in the Netherlands and Belgium taking forever.
See you there!</description>

      <description>A few years ago, back when Tumblr had not been valued a billion dollars, I wrote WWW::Tumblr, which was basically Perl bindings for their REST API. Then I forgot about it for a long time, then Yahoo! bought them or something like that. I ended up getting contacted by some Perl programmers, telling me that they were using the Perl module. Great! Anyway, following the general rule on Internet startups, Tumblr migrated most of their endpoints to OAuth and left a bunch of other resources changed to use an API key and others not.</description>

      <description>A year ago today, I started working for Booking.com. I wish I could say that the time has flown by, but it really hasn&amp;rsquo;t. It has been one hell of a ride on all fronts: work, learning experiences, friends, but specially at home, since working for this company didn&amp;rsquo;t come without a complete life change. So far so good, and for that I&amp;rsquo;m grateful :)</description>

      <description>I started working for Booking.com two weeks ago now. These last two months have been probably the most chaotic and hectic in a long time from what I remember in my life. I left New York City, chilled out in Mexico City for several weeks and then finally relocated to beautiful Amsterdam. The decision of leaving New York was not simple, but I decided to take on new challenges, one cycle had ended for me and it was time for me to move on.</description>

      <description>My professional career has been kind of an interesting one. I believe that when I diverted from being a completely stereotype of a geek, my career as an IT professional really took off. Or at least, the real experience: that experience that no words can describe on a resume but that only you have within, that experience that only comes up when you&amp;rsquo;re facing a real-life problem and no interviews or screening processes or algorithms challenges and tests can really discover.</description>

      <description>I just recently quit my job at the startup company I had been working in for almost five years. In startup terms, such long time might be a whole lifetime, but in my case, I grew liking it more and more as the years came, I had evolved from being just another engineer, to lead a team of seven great developers, with decision-making tasks and strategy planning for our technical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Deploying a Dancer app on Heroku</title>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2012/07/16/deploying-a-dancer-app-on-heroku/</guid>
      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a few different posts out there on how to run Perl apps, such as Mojolicious-based, on Heroku, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to show how to deploy a Perl Dancer application on Heroku.
The startup script of a Dancer application (bin/app.pl) can be used as a PSGI file. With that in mind, I was able to take the good work of Miyagawa&amp;rsquo;s Heroku buildpack for general PSGI apps and hack it a little bit to use Dancer&amp;rsquo;s, specifically.</description>

      <description>Geo::PostalCode is a great Perl module. It lets you find surrounding postal areas (zip codes) around a given an amount of miles (radius), calculate distance between them, among other nice features. Sadly, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work with updated data and because the file its Berkely DB installer was producing was not being recognized by its parser, which bases off on DB_File. Since I was able to find working data for the source of zip codes, I ended up hacking the module and producing a version with no Berkeley DB support.</description>

      <description>I like to read Planet Perl Iron Man, but since I&amp;rsquo;m less and less of a user of Google Reader these days, I prefer to follow interesting feeds on Twitter instead: I don&amp;rsquo;t have to digest all of the content on my timeline, only when I&amp;rsquo;m in the mood to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on out there. So, if you wanna follow the account, find it as @perlironman. If interested, you can also follow me.</description>

      <title>Perl 5.12&#39;s each function</title>

      <description>With Perl 5.12 released earlier this summer, the each function got a nice little addition that I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about: It now has the ability to work on arrays, not only key-value pair hashes, but not exactly as you&amp;rsquo;d expect it (not like Ruby&amp;rsquo;s each method).
The traditional way to work with each, using a hash:
my %h = ( a =&amp;gt; 1, b =&amp;gt; 2, c =&amp;gt; 3, ); while(my($key, $value) = each %h) { say &amp;quot;index: $key =&amp;gt; value: $value&amp;quot;; }  And the output.</description>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2010/02/11/dancertemplatehaml-now-available/</guid>
      <description>I put together a quick template engine for Dancer using Haml via Text::Haml. You know Haml, right?
Now you can do neat shit like this:
 set template =&amp;gt; &#39;haml&#39;; get &#39;/bazinga&#39;, sub { template &#39;bazinga&#39; =&amp;gt; { title =&amp;gt; &#39;Bazinga!&#39;, content =&amp;gt; &#39;Bazinga?&#39;, }; };  Using:
!!! %html{ : xmlns =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&amp;quot;, :lang =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;en&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;xml:lang&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;en&amp;quot;} %head %title= title %body #content %strong= content  The dope thing about Text::Haml is that things like the Ruby interpolation will keep working.</description>

      <description>Last week, or the one before that one, Alexis released Dancer 1.130 which represents a big refactoring of the Dancer core code, taking all optional modules away from it: Logging, session and template engines were splited into their respective non-core modules, etc. Additionally, two keyword features were added, header and prefix. I will showcase both in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the good word from them :)
header The header keyword allows you to modify or alter the response headers by hand.</description>

      <description>The Cherokee web server project is hosting the Cherokee Summit 2010 in Madrid, Spain on May 7th and 8th. The summit will be focused on high-performance and scalable Web technologies. I truly believe this is a major opportunity for hackers, developers and administrators looking for the new alternatives on the Web to bond and share experiences to benefit each other&amp;rsquo;s projects and enterprises, and keep up to date on this field.</description>

      <description>Remember Vitacilina? A small aggregation library I wrote last year to be intended to replace Planet on Planeta Linux? Well, it never quite replaced it but it achieved some level of stability since I was using it for a number of tasks at work. So, during this long holiday weekend, I received a notification that the Request To Package bug I had filled against the Work-Needing and Prospective Packages in Debian has already been taken care of and the library had been uploaded.</description>

This is a great effort by Jim Keenan, always trying to push the meetings and encouraging people on attending and sharing. There&amp;rsquo;s usually one meeting per month and it&amp;rsquo;s very well located, in midtown Manhattan, on a suite in the Ramada New Yorker hotel building facilitated by the NYPC User Group.
The first meeting will be about Git, GitHub and how you can use it on your Perl code and projects.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting the core of Planeta Linux (you can track progress here), I needed a reliable way to map a country TLD to its Spanish name. I headed to metaCPAN to see what was already built to do that and found out Locales::Country that looked awesome but didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me, code2country(&#39;ni&#39;) would return undef for me, plus the countries that were actually there had the encoding all fubar, so fuck it, drop it.</description>

      <description>Reading my morning load of feed news, I spotted an interesting bit on the New York Magazine travel feed:
Of course, someone&amp;rsquo;s doing something wrong there, but I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s their usage of XML::Feed (my guess on what they are using since the generator tag is omitted), by not dereferencing that hash reference or trying to forcibly stringify it.
Of course that comes from the feed itself:
It&amp;rsquo;s awesome, and nothing new of course, that big publications and organizations are using Perl to process and offer data to users, but I find it always super cool when they make it so obvious :)</description>

      <description>Given an awful work/travel schedule that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle in the last days, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get to Lisbon, Portugal to attend YAPC::EU, until today, day one of the conference, I was still looking forward to get a cheapish flight from Madrid, but it was just impossible, schedules wouldn&amp;rsquo;t match with my work and vacation plans. Bummer. Because of this, I will not be able to give my talk Perl in the Time of Social Networks (that I had already revisited and improved) there as it was expected for tomorrow.</description>

      <description>I attended YAPC|10 during this past week. The overall experience was quite particular, with ups and downs, but after all I made it back in one piece.
I rode a Greyhound bus on my crusade of saving a few bucks. I always had issues with buses, when I was a child I used to go from Celaya to Mexico City (and back) almost every weekend for a couple of years and I developed a phobia against the whole bus experience.</description>

      <description>The number of updates on my Twitter page kind of bothers me sometimes. It&amp;rsquo;s a reminder of the amount of time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent and wasted on Twitter, it&amp;rsquo;s an ever-itching mole in front of my face. However, I can cheat the system and society and still feel good about myself. What if I just remove all freaking replies I&amp;rsquo;ve made, except for those of people I do care about (like my fiance or Ruby Boobie)?</description>

      <title>Twitter&#39;s OAuth &#43; Perl</title>

      <description>During the last week, unbeatable Tatsuhiko Miyagawa uploaded Net::Twitter::OAuth to CPAN, which provides an awesome interface for Net::OAuth::Simple and Twitter by subclassing Net::Twitter. This way, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to develop Twitter client applications using its new OAuth method dropping the need for users to hand their credentials to third parties.
You will have to register your application on Twitter previously. You can do so here. If this is a web application that you will be building, you can provide a callback URL which is the page where the user will get redirected once she has granted access to your application.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a fantastic and exciting Perl summer.
During the last week, I received notification that the talk I&amp;rsquo;ve proposed for both YAPC::NA and YAPC::EU, was accepted.
I will be talking about Perl in the Time of Social Networks, which is mainly two broad things: how Perl can actively power a modern social networking site (I&amp;rsquo;ll be releasing a free -as in speech- social network website, similar to Lovd or RailSpace, built with pure Catalyst); and about high-load applications dealing with social networks&amp;rsquo; APIs and users (a Moose-based universal social network distributor), with Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, LastFM, and others.</description>

      <title>Regular expressions capturing in Java for Perl hackers</title>

      <description>Capturing is one of the more interesting things you can do with regular expressions, it gives you great power to get sub-strings out of strings with regex power.
I recently came up with the need to do it with Java. Having Perl background, you can understand how awful any other regular expressions implementation can be after been hacked with Perl&amp;rsquo;s, but it&amp;rsquo;s alright, it&amp;rsquo;s cool to learn.
Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s just simple, you want to capture Perl&amp;rsquo;s $0, $1, $2, etc, in your Java class.</description>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2009/02/26/googles-first-tweet/</guid>
      <description>Google created an official Twitter account. Its first tweet was something odd:
 I&amp;rsquo;m 01100110 01100101 01100101 01101100 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101100 01110101 01100011 01101011 01111001 00001010
 I had previously written (in Spanish, for La Columna de Perl), how to quickly decode this &amp;ldquo;way&amp;rdquo; of binary writing with Perl&amp;rsquo;s chr and oct. So, to find out what was Google really tweeting, run:
perl -e &#39;map { print chr oct &amp;quot;0b&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Vitacilina, ¡ah, qué buena medicina!
A few months ago. Maybe more than a year, I started hacking on Vitacilina, which was meant to be the replacement for Planet on all countries Planeta Linux supports. I was doing well, I even hosted the code back then in Google Code. Later, I forgot about it, but I&amp;rsquo;d always been wanting to replace Planet with some homebrew solution for the Planeta Linux community. Anyway, that hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet.</description>

      <description>Situation
You have a bunch of Flash videos, FLV files. Every once in a while you dump new files on your publicly accessible Apache directory. You would like to give your users the ability to play those FLVs within a webpage you provide, instead of just serving them the files for a direct download. Maybe you want this for all FLVs, not only an specific directory.
Solution
Apache2::EmbedFLV!

      <description>My friend Marco first told me on IM, then I read it on PerlBuzz. The nice High-Order Perl book by Mark Jason Dominus is now available for free (as in free beer) at its website.
This book caught my attention a long time ago on a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble once, but since I had just too many book on queue, I decided not to buy it. I then read that it&amp;rsquo;s actually a good book on advanced techniques on Perl, so my interest grew, but for random reasons I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2008/12/02/directoryindex-and-the-perl-script-handler/</guid>
      <description>Wouter Verhelst blogs about combining ScriptAlias (or a way to run CGIs) and DirectoryIndex in Apache.
Recently, developing a TinyURL clone I had a similar (not identical, though) issue.
Basically, I set SetHandler to perl-script on the &#34;/&#34; location, which basically means, everything accessed on a given virtual host, is affected. Because you are changing the handler for the entire location, DirectoryIndex will have no effect on it because mod_dir is the one dealing with the DirectoryIndex function, that is, using the DIR_MAGIC_TYPE handler.</description>

      <description>Una de las cosas más bonitas que puedes hacer gracias a mod_perl, son las PerlSections.
Básicamente con éstas, lo que puedes hacer es definir dinámicamente directivas de configuración de Apache y hacer cosas bien interesantes. Por ejemplo, recientemente, para Planeta Linux quería tener una sola configuración de Apache para los virtual hosts que son repetitivos dada cada instancia (mx.planetalinux.org, ve.planetalinux.org, gt.planetalinux.org, etc). Precisamente lo que quiero evitar es tener que poner una interminable lista de VirtualHost&amp;rsquo;s, así que lo puedo hacer con secciones en Perl (que son denotadas en cualquier archivo de configuración en Apache con &amp;lt;Perl&amp;gt; y &amp;lt;/Perl&amp;gt;):</description>

      <description>Personal stuff coming up; if you are not that kind of person, please skip :-) I forgot to say on my previous post about YAPC::NA 2008 that while I was in Chicago, I had the really nice chance to meet Carlo Segre and Dirk Eddelbuettel and enjoy a couple of nice beers with them. Great guys! I&amp;rsquo;m probably not attending DebConf this year. It&amp;rsquo;s just too expensive right now and since sponsorship appears to be not enough, chances for me are quite low now.</description>

      <description>So I attended the conference last week in Chicago, IL. I was just been procrastinating to write about this.
As a (almost) complete outsider of the Perl community, I have countered thoughts about the whole event:
 I was actually expecting a deeper technical content on some of the talks. Some speakers were just very bad at presenting, they were either boring with a very exciting topic or lacked the spark to get the audience attentive.</description>
