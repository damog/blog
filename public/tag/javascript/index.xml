      <description>I spent a couple of hours yesterday trying to debug an issue that made me hit my head against the wall while it lasted.
I run multiple instances of WordPress, and with it, comes a nice little editor bundled called TinyMCE. But on my main WordPress installation (this very blog, dear reader, where you are reading this from), TinyMCE wouldn&amp;rsquo;t come up, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t render properly on the browser, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it was my main browser, Chrome, or Firefox, Safari, cached, uncached, it was just broken.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine is asking me to publish his company&amp;rsquo;s job offering to the wild. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the offer, what they are doing and it&amp;rsquo;s a very, very nice project/opportunity, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t announce it here on my blog if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t something worthwhile: Lytix is seeking an experienced software developer with proven ability to produce, understand and critique code in C, Java and JavaScript; Perl and LISP are a plus.</description>
