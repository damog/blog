      <description>Last year, I had all the intention in the world to go to Bosnia and Herzegovina this summer to attend DebConf 11, but given my non-existent involvement on the project for the last couple of years, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for me to do it. Even last year when the event was held in town, I was not entirely thrilled about it. Life has changed quite a bit in the last few years, allowing me to just find and allocate my priorities on their right places.</description>
