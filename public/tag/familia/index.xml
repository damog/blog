      <description>Today, fifty years ago, my mother was born.
On July 24th, 1958, Vicenta Leyva gave birth to Olga Cristina Garza Leyva in the small town of Zumpango del Río (later renamed to Eduardo Neri), in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero. Her father Guillermo Garza, who is still alive, was a private pilot. Olga Cristina was named Cristina after the saint that is celebrated on the same day.
She was their third kid, a couple of years before Víctor and Guillermo were born and a couple of years after, Carlos was born, all of them being born on total different places on southern and central Mexico.</description>
