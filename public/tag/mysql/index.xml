      <description>As I tweeted yesterday, I received my new MacBook Pro. I was a bit skeptical on choosing this computer being a Linux user/developer for quite some time now. I thought it was worth giving it a try anyway. Besides, I still use my old Powerbook; as my home server since I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked the Mac hardware.

For the time being, I&amp;rsquo;m not running Debian in it, but I will install it sooner or later, for now, I&amp;rsquo;ve reached some stability and productivity on the current setup, I&amp;rsquo;m running MacPorts, which brings all the nice open source goodies to Leopard, Vimperator, TwitVim and all sort of terminal scripts to make Terminal.</description>
