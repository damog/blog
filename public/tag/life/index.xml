      <description>As of this past August 8th, I am now officially 29 years old. It seems like it was just yesterday when I was blogging about my 20th birthday, right? Well yeah, no, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly yesterday :)</description>

      <description>My professional career has been kind of an interesting one. I believe that when I diverted from being a completely stereotype of a geek, my career as an IT professional really took off. Or at least, the real experience: that experience that no words can describe on a resume but that only you have within, that experience that only comes up when you&amp;rsquo;re facing a real-life problem and no interviews or screening processes or algorithms challenges and tests can really discover.</description>

      <title>I quit</title>

      <description>I just recently quit my job at the startup company I had been working in for almost five years. In startup terms, such long time might be a whole lifetime, but in my case, I grew liking it more and more as the years came, I had evolved from being just another engineer, to lead a team of seven great developers, with decision-making tasks and strategy planning for our technical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned and real experience</title>
      <link>https://damog.net/blog/2012/03/05/lessons-learned-and-real-experience/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been building a next generation video ad serving platform with all of lessons and experience we&amp;rsquo;ve gained over the last couple of years and specially over last one. In an industry where there&amp;rsquo;s too much client demand there&amp;rsquo;s only a few key supply players doing a good job and we&amp;rsquo;ve identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We&amp;rsquo;ve kept ourselves busy.
Over the course of last year, especially on the second half and as far as this first quarter of 2012 has been running, aims for a new better product have made me reconsider what I thought I knew and what I thought I had to learn on an engineering point of view, about how to build not only regular or good software, but enterprise software.</description>

      <description>My blog has served me throughout the years as a getaway medium. I&amp;rsquo;ve found comfort writing its pages, and more recently, writing a little bit more of my technical life and whereabouts. The personal side of it, in spite of being very well handled in the past, has been left behind in recent times. And I believe Twitter has taken that part of my postings. However, I believe that a lot of the thing I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing in my life are based on the measurable fact of the impact or weight that those actions would have on my Twitter (and Facebook for that matter) stream and contacts.</description>

      <description>The fact that in a few years, we might not have a single person on this planet that was born in the 1800s (or before January 1st, 1900), makes me sad and depresses me.

      <description>Yes, those are twenty-five hands. As of yesterday 8&amp;frasl;8, I turned 25. Thanks to all of you who shouted out on Facebook, Twitter or elsewhere.
Oh, the ephemeralness of time; adulthood, a low-hanging fruit now.</description>

      <title>Back from Spain</title>

      <description>We got back from Spain yesterday. It was a nice overall vacation experience but a little too long for our own style and like, specially after spending two weeks in Mexico City. Lots of photos (at least some) are on our Flickr and some more on my TwitPic.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier to be back in New York.</description>

      <description>Personal stuff coming up; if you are not that kind of person, please skip :-) I forgot to say on my previous post about YAPC::NA 2008 that while I was in Chicago, I had the really nice chance to meet Carlo Segre and Dirk Eddelbuettel and enjoy a couple of nice beers with them. Great guys! I&amp;rsquo;m probably not attending DebConf this year. It&amp;rsquo;s just too expensive right now and since sponsorship appears to be not enough, chances for me are quite low now.</description>

      <description>En una calurosa mañana de diciembre de&amp;hellip; creo que 2005, desperté. La noche anterior había soñado que tenía una muy bonita PowerBook y que era un feliz usuario de Mac. La idea me rondó por dos minutos mientras, recostado en la cama, decidía mi futuro tecnológico. Era perfecto, utilizando mi Mac y siendo todo tan hermoso, simplemente perfecto. Perfecto imbécil terminé siendo porque me paré de la cama, me vestí, me subí al coche (así es, no me lavé los dientes, ni me bañé ni nada de eso) y me dirigí al Lumen de Insurgentes.</description>

      <description>We took a chance and traveled to Boston during the weekend. We met there with Mario Carrión, Mauro Parra and some other friends. It is a beautiful city, we walked on Boston Commons, Newbury St and got up to the Prudential Building, it was a quick visit. We also wandered around the MIT. Boston has the kind of charming touch you (or at least I) cannot find in New York City anymore.</description>
