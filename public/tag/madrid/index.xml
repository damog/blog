      <description>Given an awful work/travel schedule that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle in the last days, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get to Lisbon, Portugal to attend YAPC::EU, until today, day one of the conference, I was still looking forward to get a cheapish flight from Madrid, but it was just impossible, schedules wouldn&amp;rsquo;t match with my work and vacation plans. Bummer. Because of this, I will not be able to give my talk Perl in the Time of Social Networks (that I had already revisited and improved) there as it was expected for tomorrow.</description>
