      <description>Continuing with my WordCamp NYC talks review, I&amp;rsquo;d like to point out the notes I took attending the talk Caching and Optimization for WordPress, by Jeremy Clarke.
I believe this was a great topic to be covered for people who actively maintain WordPress installations and have to deal with upgrades, stability and reliability. However, I also think Jeremy took a much more basic approach for this topic the way it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be attending WordCamp NYC this upcoming weekend. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of very interesting talks and people speaking at the conference, so it was basically a no-brainer since it&amp;rsquo;s being held in Manhattan. Plus, WordPress is one of the platforms I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked and admired on how they have achieved to become a mainstream product with a huge amount of active users and developers. I started using it way back in 2004 when it was b2/cafelog, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a long ride.</description>
