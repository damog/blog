      <description>I recently stumbled upon FeatherCast, a nice little project made by Rich Bowen and David Reid, the former, a recognized documenter within the Apache community, author of a few books on the webserver, mainly the Apache Cookbook. FeatherCast is an unofficial podcast; its primary goal is supporting the Apache Software Foundation community. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be greatly interesting, modern and up to date; more recently, bringing lights to some of the content and people, for instance, featured on ApacheCon, which took place in New Orleans, LA, late last year.</description>
