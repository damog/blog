      <description>This is going to be a fantastic and exciting Perl summer.
During the last week, I received notification that the talk I&amp;rsquo;ve proposed for both YAPC::NA and YAPC::EU, was accepted.
I will be talking about Perl in the Time of Social Networks, which is mainly two broad things: how Perl can actively power a modern social networking site (I&amp;rsquo;ll be releasing a free -as in speech- social network website, similar to Lovd or RailSpace, built with pure Catalyst); and about high-load applications dealing with social networks&amp;rsquo; APIs and users (a Moose-based universal social network distributor), with Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, LastFM, and others.</description>

      <description>Raquel and I came to San Francisco for a couple of days during this week, mainly to attend the MySpace DevJam. It was a great experience to get to know the west coast as we hadn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to come over. We also had the opportunity to meet with my great friend Marco Manzo, who is working for Leap Frog in the Bay Area.
On the MySpace side, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see that some real and good improvements are being made to open the platform as much as possible.</description>
