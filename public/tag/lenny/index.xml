      <description>So, Biella already posted a reminder, and I&amp;rsquo;m doing it again on my blog, here. Attention New York City Debianistas,
The astrological confluence of 1234567890[0], the impending release of Lenny[1], and the odd sighting of a horned mythical beast that cryptozoologists are calling a &amp;lsquo;new FTP-master-assistant/slave&amp;rsquo; being sighted in the mist off the shores of the East River[2] will result in all emacs users to transcend and all vim users to be transponded to their respective motherships, which are scheduled for near-orbit on that night.</description>

      <description>Well, it is actually Iceweasel 3 for Debian testing. Iceweasel just hit unstable yesterday (it had been for a while on experimental) and if you are running testing and can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it to get through QA, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a backport for you:
 deb http://debian.axiombox.com/ testing main
 The newest xulrunner was also backported, which was, yes, the whole point for this.
UPDATE: Iceweasel 3 was uploaded a couple of weeks now, not yesterday :)</description>
