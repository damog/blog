      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed reading Sarah Hatter&amp;rsquo;s (from 37signals) blog post about phone support. I can&amp;rsquo;t say anything else that I totally agree about it, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my own experience.
Recently, I bought a ticket for my mom to come to visit us in New York. She finally couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it for the dates we had picked so I had to cancel the airline ticket that I had already paid in Orbitz.</description>
