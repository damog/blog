      <description>This is going to be a fantastic and exciting Perl summer.
During the last week, I received notification that the talk I&amp;rsquo;ve proposed for both YAPC::NA and YAPC::EU, was accepted.
I will be talking about Perl in the Time of Social Networks, which is mainly two broad things: how Perl can actively power a modern social networking site (I&amp;rsquo;ll be releasing a free -as in speech- social network website, similar to Lovd or RailSpace, built with pure Catalyst); and about high-load applications dealing with social networks&amp;rsquo; APIs and users (a Moose-based universal social network distributor), with Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, LastFM, and others.</description>
