      <description>Continuing my notes and remarks from WordCamp, I attended Writing Secure Plugins, which was given by Mark Jaquith (@markjaquith on Twitter). I found the talk to be also slightly introductory on security matters but nicely oriented to WordPress plugins and general PHP Web app development. I believe most of the tips given should be taken into consideration by every PHP coder out there, not just WP people. 
The talk was split into the different attacks that are common on Web applications and mainly pointing to functions and actions to be taken.</description>
