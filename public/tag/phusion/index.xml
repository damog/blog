      <description>Wouter, I find your thinking on DebGem a bit overreacted. I think you are taking the product and commercial efforts that a company make as the proposed solution we&amp;rsquo;ve all been expecting for a similar problem, which is not. You are considering DebGem to be an outcome provided by the Ruby community, which is not, to this issue.
Phusion is obviously not the Ruby community, but part of it. How I see it, it&amp;rsquo;s great: I applaud that more companies take a look at nice technologies and try to provide their own products.</description>
