      <description>RVM hates my guts. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because I hate RVM back even more. Since I was technologically raised by aging wolfs, I have strong reasons to believe that you just shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have mixed versions of software on your production systems, specially, if a lot of things are poorly tested, like most of Ruby libraries, aren&amp;rsquo;t backward compatible. I was raised on a world where everything worked greatly because the good folks at projects like Debian or Perl have some of the greatest QA processes of all time, hands down.</description>

      <description>I just uploaded Feedbag 0.6 to Gemcutter and GitHub.
Just a couple of small nice additions to this version:
 The undocumented args[:narrow] option has been disabled until further notice. A nice little commit from one of Feedbag&amp;rsquo;s forks, by Patrick Reagan. Added an executable to find feed URLs directly.  Sometimes you need to find the feed for a URL quickly, not from a script. What I do, and what someone else showed me too, is this:</description>

      <title>MacBook Pro</title>

      <description>As I tweeted yesterday, I received my new MacBook Pro. I was a bit skeptical on choosing this computer being a Linux user/developer for quite some time now. I thought it was worth giving it a try anyway. Besides, I still use my old Powerbook; as my home server since I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked the Mac hardware.

For the time being, I&amp;rsquo;m not running Debian in it, but I will install it sooner or later, for now, I&amp;rsquo;ve reached some stability and productivity on the current setup, I&amp;rsquo;m running MacPorts, which brings all the nice open source goodies to Leopard, Vimperator, TwitVim and all sort of terminal scripts to make Terminal.</description>
