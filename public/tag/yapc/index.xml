      <description>Given an awful work/travel schedule that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle in the last days, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get to Lisbon, Portugal to attend YAPC::EU, until today, day one of the conference, I was still looking forward to get a cheapish flight from Madrid, but it was just impossible, schedules wouldn&amp;rsquo;t match with my work and vacation plans. Bummer. Because of this, I will not be able to give my talk Perl in the Time of Social Networks (that I had already revisited and improved) there as it was expected for tomorrow.</description>

      <description>I attended YAPC|10 during this past week. The overall experience was quite particular, with ups and downs, but after all I made it back in one piece.
I rode a Greyhound bus on my crusade of saving a few bucks. I always had issues with buses, when I was a child I used to go from Celaya to Mexico City (and back) almost every weekend for a couple of years and I developed a phobia against the whole bus experience.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a fantastic and exciting Perl summer.
During the last week, I received notification that the talk I&amp;rsquo;ve proposed for both YAPC::NA and YAPC::EU, was accepted.
I will be talking about Perl in the Time of Social Networks, which is mainly two broad things: how Perl can actively power a modern social networking site (I&amp;rsquo;ll be releasing a free -as in speech- social network website, similar to Lovd or RailSpace, built with pure Catalyst); and about high-load applications dealing with social networks&amp;rsquo; APIs and users (a Moose-based universal social network distributor), with Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, LastFM, and others.</description>
