      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been building a next generation video ad serving platform with all of lessons and experience we&amp;rsquo;ve gained over the last couple of years and specially over last one. In an industry where there&amp;rsquo;s too much client demand there&amp;rsquo;s only a few key supply players doing a good job and we&amp;rsquo;ve identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We&amp;rsquo;ve kept ourselves busy.
Over the course of last year, especially on the second half and as far as this first quarter of 2012 has been running, aims for a new better product have made me reconsider what I thought I knew and what I thought I had to learn on an engineering point of view, about how to build not only regular or good software, but enterprise software.</description>
