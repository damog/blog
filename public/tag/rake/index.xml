      <description>RVM hates my guts. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because I hate RVM back even more. Since I was technologically raised by aging wolfs, I have strong reasons to believe that you just shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have mixed versions of software on your production systems, specially, if a lot of things are poorly tested, like most of Ruby libraries, aren&amp;rsquo;t backward compatible. I was raised on a world where everything worked greatly because the good folks at projects like Debian or Perl have some of the greatest QA processes of all time, hands down.</description>
