      <description>We ordered a family pack of Snow Leopard for the whole development team last Tuesday. They arrived yesterday Friday, early morning.
A few thing don&amp;rsquo;t work entirely as they were, which was expectable, among other things: MacPorts starts broken (but you simply have to upgrade to the actual Snow Leopard version). Visor only works on position Full-Screen. iStat Menus simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t. No support for GrowMail yet neither. And everything else does, as far as I can tell.</description>
