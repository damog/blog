      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s very sad when projects close down because of lack of financial interest on them. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that on very near projects to me in the last couple of years and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop getting me sad. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s tr.im, which was a nice URL shortening service.
They weren&amp;rsquo;t, of course, anything new, but it was really cool. They had a great short domain name and it just worked, plus they weren&amp;rsquo;t one of the shitty services like Twitter-whore bit.</description>
