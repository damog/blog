      <description>During last weekend&amp;rsquo;s WordCamp, Jeremy Clarke gave a bunch of tips for websites server optimizations (I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize my views on his talk later on a separate post) and he showcased a plugin for Firebug that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about and caught my attention: Yahoo! YSlow. It is a really nice piece of software, it adds a tab on your Firebug window and will grade the performance of the web page you are browsing with a set of tips on how to make it faster, ranging from images, CSS, JavaScript, headers, etc:</description>

      <description>Well, it is actually Iceweasel 3 for Debian testing. Iceweasel just hit unstable yesterday (it had been for a while on experimental) and if you are running testing and can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it to get through QA, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a backport for you:
 deb http://debian.axiombox.com/ testing main
 The newest xulrunner was also backported, which was, yes, the whole point for this.
UPDATE: Iceweasel 3 was uploaded a couple of weeks now, not yesterday :)</description>
