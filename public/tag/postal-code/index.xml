      <description>Geo::PostalCode is a great Perl module. It lets you find surrounding postal areas (zip codes) around a given an amount of miles (radius), calculate distance between them, among other nice features. Sadly, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work with updated data and because the file its Berkely DB installer was producing was not being recognized by its parser, which bases off on DB_File. Since I was able to find working data for the source of zip codes, I ended up hacking the module and producing a version with no Berkeley DB support.</description>
