<p>I started working for <a href="http://www.booking.com">Booking.com</a> two weeks ago now. These last two months have been probably the most chaotic and hectic in a long time from what I remember in my life. I left New York City, chilled out in Mexico City for several weeks and then finally relocated to beautiful Amsterdam. The decision of leaving New York was not simple, but I decided to take on new challenges, one cycle had ended for me and it was time for me to move on.</p>

<p>The change has not been easy, but it hasn&rsquo;t been bad at all. I knew that coming from a very mutating startup in New York City into a company with presence in dozens of countries and several thousand employees was not gonna be a simple change. I decided to proceed with this because I want to learn. I want to learn how other businesses use technology, specially the kind that I&rsquo;m most interested on, to become successful. I want to understand how they operate. I want to help a company succeed, take on new technology lessons and learn from more experienced peers. Thankfully, I&rsquo;m not financially burdened and I&rsquo;m able to make this decision myself without affecting (too much) others. I wanted the adventure (again) of relocating to a new country and making it to a company that has been successful for so many years, hugely based in Perl, who has contributed <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2012/01/bookingcom-sponsors-100000-to.html">boldly</a> to its community, with so many great Perl developers in the mix, etc., just made it all worth it.</p>

<p>Being a new guy is never easy, and I haven&rsquo;t really been one of those often. I wish I knew how a lot of things work already, so I was able to contribute faster. At the end, this is all about a business and it&rsquo;s about what developers and engineers do to contribute, to give back, to produce something that ends up as revenue and profit, and I want to do just that. Benefits and perks are always nice, but what I really want is prove to myself and to those who hired me the kind of competent talent that I am.</p>

<p>If you can understand Spanish, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXNMKIK8OOw">video</a> explains it better.</p>

<p>Oh and yeah, I turned 28 during my first week of work here in the Netherlands and was lucky enough to have a very happy one with plenty of hopes and goals.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
