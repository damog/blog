<p>So, here I am in Jamaica, NY, near the JFK airport. Flyglobspan’s flight to Liverpool was cancelled and scheduled until next Monday. This simply sucks and I don’t have any energy left for flaming anybody, I just did it too much during the afternoon. Just as <a href="http://frisia.middle-earth.us/2007/06/10/and-straight-on-til-morning/" target="_blank">Christine</a>, I shouldn’t have booked with this crappy company, due to my <a href="http://www.damog.net/20070504/to-edinburgh/" target="_blank">previous feelings about this</a>. A lady was flying on Tuesday, and they rescheduled her itinerary to today, and they simply re-rescheduled now for Monday.</p>

<p>Also, I already had an scheduled train from Liverpool to Edinburgh and an open return. If I don’t get my way to the UK on Monday, I’ll simply won’t be able to make it for DebConf, since I had planned to get back from Edinburgh to Liverpool on Friday night or Saturday morning, Raquel could join me in NYC before of what we had planned (Saturday evening).</p>

<p>At least, the airline is paying for a hotel. So, I’m stuck here, with two bottles of tequila, one of mezcal, a bottle of extra-spicy Valentina, a pack of pingüinitos, which all were presents for buddies, and all energy I wanted to spend with friends in Edinburgh. Such is life.</p>

<p>I’m going out right now actually. I’ll see if I can catch some jazz somewhere in NYC. If any Debianer or Perler is around the neighborhood, feel free to call/text to +525529009939.</p>
