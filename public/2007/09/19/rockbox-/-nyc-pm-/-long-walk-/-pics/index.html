<p>So, I have just installed <a href="http://www.rockbox.org" target="_blank">RockBox</a> on my iPod and I have liberated it :) It&#8217;s nice to see people amazed on an iPod running something that&#8217;s different from the usual firmware. Now, both my iPod and PowerBook are not running Apple software, muahaha!

<p>Since we are in NYC now, and even before, we&#8217;ve been looking for interesting activities in the area. Tomorrow, the New York City Perl Mongers will handle their monthly meeting. At 6:30 PM at d.b.a, 41 First Avenue (between 2nd and 3rd Streets), map: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2yqg4d" target="_blank"><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2yqg4d">http://tinyurl.com/2yqg4d</a></a>. Tomorrow, we were supposed to go see a prospective apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn in the afternoon; I&#8217;ll see if we can still make it. Otherwise, if you are in the area, feel free to attend! </p>

<p>Yesterday, we went to the Yankee Stadium. Actually we only went outside it, since we didn&#8217;t carry any tickets, we just wanted to see the neighborhood. It was amazing, since there was a game and we witnessed thounds of people commuting to it to watch the game. It was a nice experience only watching the people and all the buzz around the stadium. After that, we got back to Manhattan on the subway and dropped off on the 57th and Madison Ave: From there, we walked around sixty freaking blocks to get to our apartment near Essex &amp; Delancey St. After checking on Google maps, it was a ~6 kms walk! It only took us 2:30 hrs. Heh. On the good side, we happened to see lots of nice places of Lexington and other avenues.Tonight, we&#8217;ll be walking to Little Italy and Chinatown, although we already know those neighborhoods, since Alex took us there when were here last June.

<p>So, we are uploading our pics to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raquelydavid/sets/72157602073690584/" target="_blank">NYC photo set</a> of our flickr account, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raquelydavid/" target="_blank">raquelydavid</a>. </p>
