<p>Two weekends ago, <a target="_blank" href="http://raquelhernandez.net/">Raquel</a> and I went to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHCP">RHCP</a> at Foro Sol, on eastern Mexico City. She already blogged a bit about it (in Spanish).</p>

<p>It was fuckingly awesome. They still rock the way the have been doing it for so many years (no matter what abrotman or resiak say about them). A set of huge leds screens were put all the way through the stage and beyond. The sound was excellent for such a big place and they simply got the audience. Frusciante is already a master on guitar playing and I also like Kiedis not being the big star being the vocalist. Flea also showed why his bass is respected between other rock bassists.</p>

<p>Some of the press also applauded their opening band, Modest Mouse. In spite of I really like some of their songs, they sounded like crap and we just didn&#8217;t like them. The crowd cheered up some songs like Dashboard, Float On or Ocean Breathes Salty but they suddenly got tired and started asking for the main dish by calling &#8220;Red Hot, Red Hot&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, the Stadium Arcadium tour in Mexico City by the RHCP was a total success and a delight for all the fans. You can&#8217;t imagine how they can rock +30&#8217;000 people with Can&#8217;t Stop, Californication, The Zephyr Song or Give It Away, no matter the cold and continous rain all over the place.</p>

<p>Sadly, and following press and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gwolf.org">Gunnar</a>&#8217;s advice, we got there in public transportation. I understand the local authorities should have issues handling +30&#8217;000 people getting out the place at once on several ways, but closing the nearest subway station, Ciudad Deportiva, is just insane for people. We had to walk all the way through Viaducto, crossing Churubusco and we almost didn&#8217;t make it to Vel√≥dromo as we took the last train passing on the station. This, added to the rain, the high prices for taxis and such, made a huge mistake not to get there by car. No matter what, next time we&#8217;ll get to Palacio de los Deportes or Foro Sol, we&#8217;ll prefer to pay 50 pesos for the parking lot and get some traffic (not too much on Saturday anyway) than feeling lost without a proper way to get home. Still, the concert totally worth it :-)</p>
