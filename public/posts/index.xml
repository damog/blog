      <description>Got myself a XPS 13&amp;rdquo; 9380 that Dell just released as &amp;ldquo;Developer Edition&amp;rdquo; with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS pre-installed. They just released it on January 2019.
Ubuntu didn&amp;rsquo;t last long though. I prefer OS X Mojave than any of the Ubuntu installations. It&amp;rsquo;s okay though, it&amp;rsquo;s just not for me.
Big big big shoutout to Jérémy Garrouste for his documentation only a few days ago of the Debian installation for Buster on the laptop which helped me figure out I needed to upgrade the BIOS to fix a couple of issues and be able to run the d-i alpha 5 with the Atheros drivers.</description>

      <description>Spent the Saturday at FOSDEM with my friend jackdoe.
It was great to both see some and avoid other familiar faces. It was great to meet some unfamiliar faces as well.
Until next year! Maybe.</description>

      <description>Como que ya iba siendo tiempo de darle cuello al agregador automático de Planeta Linux. Nos sirvió por mucho tiempo, pero ya era hora de no tener un sitio tan muerto. La gente ya no bloguea tanto ni nada, entonces mejor evolucionar esa comunidad.
Las páginas de comunidad en Facebook y Twitter seguirán abiertas. Igual y la banda quiere darle un empujón. A ver qué sale.
Muchas gracias a los carnales que han trabajado en el sitio por años, especialmente a vicm3, julioh y hace años a Milton.</description>

      <title>Webhook Setup with Facebook::Messenger::Bot</title>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2016/08/29/webhook-setup-with-facebookmessengerbot/</guid>
      <description>The documentation for the Facebook Messenger API points out how to setup your initial bot webhook. I just committed a quick patch that would make it very easy to setup a quick script to get it done using the unreleased and still in progress Perl&amp;rsquo;s Facebook::Messenger::Bot:
use Facebook::Messenger::Bot; use constant VERIFY_TOKEN =&amp;gt; &#39;imsosecret&#39;; my $bot = Facebook::Messenger::Bot-&amp;gt;new(); # no config specified! $bot-&amp;gt;expect_verify_token( VERIFY_TOKEN ); $bot-&amp;gt;spin();  This should get you sorted.</description>

      <title>WIP: Perl bindings for Facebook Messenger</title>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2016/08/21/wip-perl-bindings-for-facebook-messenger/</guid>
      <description>A couple of weeks ago I started looking into wrapping the Facebook Messenger API into Perl. Since all the calls are extremely simple using a REST API, I thought it could be easier and simpler even, to provide a small framework to hook bots using PSGI/Plack.
So I started putting some things together and with a very simple interface you could do a lot:
use strict; use warnings; use Facebook::Messenger::Bot; my $bot = Facebook::Messenger::Bot-&amp;gt;new({ access_token =&amp;gt; &#39;.</description>

      <description>Just a very quick shout out.
A few weeks/months ago, Planeta Linux lost its hosting. As I&amp;rsquo;m less and less involved on third party projects, it was a bit hard for me to just put it somewhere else. Víctor, however, approached me and offered to pay for it. A few days later, we hosted Planeta Linux on one of his hosting instances. A big round of applause goes to him! He is the one making that community possible.</description>

      <description>Hey Michael Stapelberg, thanks for creating i3 and making me believe again that people have a clue and things can be done just right (specially when it comes to something easily done crappy like window managers). Thanks for just getting it all right, and not only from the software point of view, but also for the community, the style around it, etc. Kudos.</description>

      <description>I just booked my train tickets for FOSDEM 2014. Accommodation will be sorted out later.
This year I planned it well in advance to get decent prices for Thalys, unlike last year that we ended up riding the slow trains that stop in every single town in the Netherlands and Belgium taking forever.
See you there!</description>

      <description>A few years ago, back when Tumblr had not been valued a billion dollars, I wrote WWW::Tumblr, which was basically Perl bindings for their REST API. Then I forgot about it for a long time, then Yahoo! bought them or something like that. I ended up getting contacted by some Perl programmers, telling me that they were using the Perl module. Great! Anyway, following the general rule on Internet startups, Tumblr migrated most of their endpoints to OAuth and left a bunch of other resources changed to use an API key and others not.</description>

      <description>A year ago today, I started working for Booking.com. I wish I could say that the time has flown by, but it really hasn&amp;rsquo;t. It has been one hell of a ride on all fronts: work, learning experiences, friends, but specially at home, since working for this company didn&amp;rsquo;t come without a complete life change. So far so good, and for that I&amp;rsquo;m grateful :)</description>

      <description>I started working for Booking.com two weeks ago now. These last two months have been probably the most chaotic and hectic in a long time from what I remember in my life. I left New York City, chilled out in Mexico City for several weeks and then finally relocated to beautiful Amsterdam. The decision of leaving New York was not simple, but I decided to take on new challenges, one cycle had ended for me and it was time for me to move on.</description>

      <description>My professional career has been kind of an interesting one. I believe that when I diverted from being a completely stereotype of a geek, my career as an IT professional really took off. Or at least, the real experience: that experience that no words can describe on a resume but that only you have within, that experience that only comes up when you&amp;rsquo;re facing a real-life problem and no interviews or screening processes or algorithms challenges and tests can really discover.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a few different posts out there on how to run Perl apps, such as Mojolicious-based, on Heroku, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to show how to deploy a Perl Dancer application on Heroku.
The startup script of a Dancer application (bin/app.pl) can be used as a PSGI file. With that in mind, I was able to take the good work of Miyagawa&amp;rsquo;s Heroku buildpack for general PSGI apps and hack it a little bit to use Dancer&amp;rsquo;s, specifically.</description>

      <description>Geo::PostalCode is a great Perl module. It lets you find surrounding postal areas (zip codes) around a given an amount of miles (radius), calculate distance between them, among other nice features. Sadly, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work with updated data and because the file its Berkely DB installer was producing was not being recognized by its parser, which bases off on DB_File. Since I was able to find working data for the source of zip codes, I ended up hacking the module and producing a version with no Berkeley DB support.</description>

      <description>I was contacted by Pivotal Labs regarding licensing of Feedbag. I guess releasing open source software as GPL only makes sense if you continue to live under a rock. I&amp;rsquo;ve bumped the version to 0.9 and released it under MIT license.
Feedbag 1.0, which I plan to work on during the following days will bring in a brand new shiny backend powered by Nokogiri, instead of Hpricot (I mean, give me a break, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to catch up with the Ruby community, after all I&amp;rsquo;m primarily a Perl guy :D) and hopefully I will be able to recreate most of the feed auto-discovery test suite that Mark Pilgrim retired (410 Gone) when he committed infosuicide.</description>

      <description>For the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been ranting a little too much with our engineering team about GitHub. These rantings, of course, didn&amp;rsquo;t come out of the blue. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been too satisfied with GitHub&amp;rsquo;s reliability lately since we use it for our daily development and constant deployment on our different staging environments and our own operation has been affected by their recent multiple technical difficulties. This has led me to analyze whether we really need them, why we started paying for their service in the first place and if it&amp;rsquo;s really necessary for our product development in the first place.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned and real experience</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been building a next generation video ad serving platform with all of lessons and experience we&amp;rsquo;ve gained over the last couple of years and specially over last one. In an industry where there&amp;rsquo;s too much client demand there&amp;rsquo;s only a few key supply players doing a good job and we&amp;rsquo;ve identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We&amp;rsquo;ve kept ourselves busy.
Over the course of last year, especially on the second half and as far as this first quarter of 2012 has been running, aims for a new better product have made me reconsider what I thought I knew and what I thought I had to learn on an engineering point of view, about how to build not only regular or good software, but enterprise software.</description>

      <description>RVM hates my guts. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because I hate RVM back even more. Since I was technologically raised by aging wolfs, I have strong reasons to believe that you just shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have mixed versions of software on your production systems, specially, if a lot of things are poorly tested, like most of Ruby libraries, aren&amp;rsquo;t backward compatible. I was raised on a world where everything worked greatly because the good folks at projects like Debian or Perl have some of the greatest QA processes of all time, hands down.</description>

      <description>Last year, I had all the intention in the world to go to Bosnia and Herzegovina this summer to attend DebConf 11, but given my non-existent involvement on the project for the last couple of years, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason for me to do it. Even last year when the event was held in town, I was not entirely thrilled about it. Life has changed quite a bit in the last few years, allowing me to just find and allocate my priorities on their right places.</description>

      <title>Disable Nginx logging</title>

      <description>This is something that is specified clearly on the Nginx manual, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have it as a quick reference.
The access_log and error_log directives on Nginx are on separate modules (HTTP Log and Core modules respectively) and they don&amp;rsquo;t behave the same way when all you want is to disable all logging on your server (in our case, we serve a gazillion static files and perform a lot of reverse proxying and we&amp;rsquo;re not interested on tracking that).</description>

      <description>I am a huge fan of LinkedIn, I love it. Handled properly, it can allow you to establish great opportunities that eventually lead up to either work or paid gigs and we all know how good money is, right? I have spent time for the last couple of weeks making sure my own LinkedIn profile is complete, fully up-to-date and that I&amp;rsquo;m taking full advantage of all the features that the site has to offer, and even though I&amp;rsquo;m not actively looking for a job it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to get contacted by other developers or directors (heck, even recruiters) inviting you to consider other job opportunities.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re also nerd enough, make sure to send them feedback and shit.</description>

      <description>I like to read Planet Perl Iron Man, but since I&amp;rsquo;m less and less of a user of Google Reader these days, I prefer to follow interesting feeds on Twitter instead: I don&amp;rsquo;t have to digest all of the content on my timeline, only when I&amp;rsquo;m in the mood to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on out there. So, if you wanna follow the account, find it as @perlironman. If interested, you can also follow me.</description>

      <description>I spent a couple of minutes today trying to understand how to make find (1) to execute two commands on the same target.
Instead of this or any similar crappy variants:
$ find . -type d -iname &amp;quot;*0&amp;quot; -mtime +60 -exec scp -r -P 1337 &amp;quot;{}&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meh.server.com:/mnt/1/backup/storage&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rm -rf &amp;quot;{}&amp;quot; \;  Try something like this:
$ find . -type d -iname &amp;quot;*0&amp;quot; -mtime +60 -exec scp -r -P 1337 &amp;quot;{}&amp;quot; &amp;quot;meh.</description>

      <description>With Perl 5.12 released earlier this summer, the each function got a nice little addition that I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about: It now has the ability to work on arrays, not only key-value pair hashes, but not exactly as you&amp;rsquo;d expect it (not like Ruby&amp;rsquo;s each method).
The traditional way to work with each, using a hash:
my %h = ( a =&amp;gt; 1, b =&amp;gt; 2, c =&amp;gt; 3, ); while(my($key, $value) = each %h) { say &amp;quot;index: $key =&amp;gt; value: $value&amp;quot;; }  And the output.</description>

      <description>Apache2::Archive is a mod_perl 2 extension that allows the Apache HTTP server to expose tar and tar.gz archives on the fly. When a client requests such an archive file, the server will return a page displaying information about the file that allows the user to view or download individual files from within the archive.
I just uploaded version 0.2 to CPAN and GitHub correcting a few automatic build issues presented with dependencies.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing a Rails application for the microblogging strategy for Debian (which I used to call, debian-twitter, but you know how us Debian folks are :D). I came up with a strange issue, that at first I thought was ActionController&amp;rsquo;s fault or some crap.
So, I was testing one of my controllers with something like this:
cat /tmp/mm.txt | curl -d @- http://localhost:3000/message/new  /tmp/mm.txt is a PGP signed message which then I just send as POST data to my application.</description>

Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to attend talks or go hang out with folks as much as I would&amp;rsquo;ve wanted. Most of the time I was busy at the office with a new product launch we have been preparing for the last few months. However, I was able to come and say hi to a few people, attend the C&amp;amp;W party and talk with friends and ran into.</description>

Well, since I still wanted to read the top stories, but they don&amp;rsquo;t provide such a feed, like Lifehacker (kind of) does, I hacked a feed (no longer active):</description>

Just a couple of small nice additions to this version:
 The undocumented args[:narrow] option has been disabled until further notice. A nice little commit from one of Feedbag&amp;rsquo;s forks, by Patrick Reagan. Added an executable to find feed URLs directly.  Sometimes you need to find the feed for a URL quickly, not from a script. What I do, and what someone else showed me too, is this:</description>

Now you can do neat shit like this:
 set template =&amp;gt; &#39;haml&#39;; get &#39;/bazinga&#39;, sub { template &#39;bazinga&#39; =&amp;gt; { title =&amp;gt; &#39;Bazinga!&#39;, content =&amp;gt; &#39;Bazinga?&#39;, }; };  Using:
!!! %html{ : xmlns =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&amp;quot;, :lang =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;en&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;xml:lang&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;en&amp;quot;} %head %title= title %body #content %strong= content  The dope thing about Text::Haml is that things like the Ruby interpolation will keep working.</description>

      <description>Last week, or the one before that one, Alexis released Dancer 1.130 which represents a big refactoring of the Dancer core code, taking all optional modules away from it: Logging, session and template engines were splited into their respective non-core modules, etc. Additionally, two keyword features were added, header and prefix. I will showcase both in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the good word from them :)
header The header keyword allows you to modify or alter the response headers by hand.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve never liked it, as a matter of fact, I have no actual idea why I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it on my blog. I do know why I used it on the country feeds on Planeta Linux, and that is because it was very easy to mask all of our URL changes with some level of stability on the subscribers (in times where me being technically competent was a bad joke for myself).</description>

I run multiple instances of WordPress, and with it, comes a nice little editor bundled called TinyMCE. But on my main WordPress installation (this very blog, dear reader, where you are reading this from), TinyMCE wouldn&amp;rsquo;t come up, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t render properly on the browser, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it was my main browser, Chrome, or Firefox, Safari, cached, uncached, it was just broken.</description>

      <description>The fact that the Amazon Kindle per se exists, has attracted a copious amount of comparisons to the now unveiled Apple iPad. The Kindle of course, is a (reportedly, I don&amp;rsquo;t own one) great e-book reader and Sudoku console. One should be comparing apples to apples, since comparing these two devices is like comparing a Nokia 5110, with an iPhone (ok bigots, or with a NexusOne), simply different times, different action scenarios.</description>

      <description>I spent some minutes today at work figuring out why a script we use for files and assets propagation wasn&amp;rsquo;t working when fired up under God, but it actually was working when run as its normal user.
The script is a Sinatra application that, upon pings/requests, connects through SSH to different servers on our clusters and execute commands. Details on the implementation are irrelevant here. Since this is automatized, we use key files for the SSH authentication.</description>

      <description>I recently read a blog&#39;s about page where the autor mentioned to have 11 years of programming experience, parenthesizing that he started really young. Although I certainly don&#39;t think any serious professional experience should include the kind of coding you do as a kid, it made me remember how I started programming myself when I was a a child.
I didn&#39;t have my own computer before 1996, when I started secundaria (junior high school).</description>

      <description>The Cherokee web server project is hosting the Cherokee Summit 2010 in Madrid, Spain on May 7th and 8th. The summit will be focused on high-performance and scalable Web technologies. I truly believe this is a major opportunity for hackers, developers and administrators looking for the new alternatives on the Web to bond and share experiences to benefit each other&amp;rsquo;s projects and enterprises, and keep up to date on this field.</description>

      <description>My blog has served me throughout the years as a getaway medium. I&amp;rsquo;ve found comfort writing its pages, and more recently, writing a little bit more of my technical life and whereabouts. The personal side of it, in spite of being very well handled in the past, has been left behind in recent times. And I believe Twitter has taken that part of my postings. However, I believe that a lot of the thing I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing in my life are based on the measurable fact of the impact or weight that those actions would have on my Twitter (and Facebook for that matter) stream and contacts.</description>

      <description>Continuing with my WordCamp NYC talks review, I&amp;rsquo;d like to point out the notes I took attending the talk Caching and Optimization for WordPress, by Jeremy Clarke.
I believe this was a great topic to be covered for people who actively maintain WordPress installations and have to deal with upgrades, stability and reliability. However, I also think Jeremy took a much more basic approach for this topic the way it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be.</description>

      <description>Remember Vitacilina? A small aggregation library I wrote last year to be intended to replace Planet on Planeta Linux? Well, it never quite replaced it but it achieved some level of stability since I was using it for a number of tasks at work. So, during this long holiday weekend, I received a notification that the Request To Package bug I had filled against the Work-Needing and Prospective Packages in Debian has already been taken care of and the library had been uploaded.</description>

      <description>Continuing my notes and remarks from WordCamp, I attended Writing Secure Plugins, which was given by Mark Jaquith (@markjaquith on Twitter). I found the talk to be also slightly introductory on security matters but nicely oriented to WordPress plugins and general PHP Web app development. I believe most of the tips given should be taken into consideration by every PHP coder out there, not just WP people. 
The talk was split into the different attacks that are common on Web applications and mainly pointing to functions and actions to be taken.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s very pleasant for me to announce that the probably most descriptive domain name in Mexico for Linux, linux.org.mx, is now powered by Planeta Linux México.
I see this as a great milestone of all the members of the Mexican Linux community that have made Planeta Linux the number one Web site in Mexico for Linux. Also, please raise your drinks for @negrabarba, who made this possible, administrator of the DNS at UPN, where the domain name points to; and of course for Miguel, the owner of it.</description>

      <description>Here I start a series of posts with my comments, notes and remarks on the talks that I attended at last weekend&amp;rsquo;s WordCamp in NYC.
The first talk I attended was Securing WordPress, by Brad Williams (@williamsba on Twitter). First off, this talk wasn&amp;rsquo;t too technical since it was focused to beginning developers whose background wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be completely into systems administration, it was intended to a broader audience, which is exactly why I liked it so much and started taking notes.</description>

YSlow. It is a really nice piece of software, it adds a tab on your Firebug window and will grade the performance of the web page you are browsing with a set of tips on how to make it faster, ranging from images, CSS, JavaScript, headers, etc:</description>

If you ever have the opportunity, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss the chance to attend one of them, it&amp;rsquo;s really inspiring, people is very, very welcome and I loved the fact that there&amp;rsquo;s so many people with all sorts of backgrounds and focused on many fronts on the Web and blogging world, not just technical.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be attending WordCamp NYC this upcoming weekend. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of very interesting talks and people speaking at the conference, so it was basically a no-brainer since it&amp;rsquo;s being held in Manhattan. Plus, WordPress is one of the platforms I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked and admired on how they have achieved to become a mainstream product with a huge amount of active users and developers. I started using it way back in 2004 when it was b2/cafelog, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a long ride.</description>

So this is the first attempt to bring new comers to Debian aiming DebConf10 next summer. Micah and dkg are the ones leading the workshop so far.

      <description>This next Tuesday October 20th, the Perl Seminar returns to New York City! This is a great effort by Jim Keenan, always trying to push the meetings and encouraging people on attending and sharing. There&amp;rsquo;s usually one meeting per month and it&amp;rsquo;s very well located, in midtown Manhattan, on a suite in the Ramada New Yorker hotel building facilitated by the NYPC User Group.
The first meeting will be about Git, GitHub and how you can use it on your Perl code and projects.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m rewriting the core of Planeta Linux (you can track progress here), I needed a reliable way to map a country TLD to its Spanish name. I headed to metaCPAN to see what was already built to do that and found out Locales::Country that looked awesome but didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me, code2country(&#39;ni&#39;) would return undef for me, plus the countries that were actually there had the encoding all fubar, so fuck it, drop it.</description>

      <description>We ordered a family pack of Snow Leopard for the whole development team last Tuesday. They arrived yesterday Friday, early morning.
A few thing don&amp;rsquo;t work entirely as they were, which was expectable, among other things: MacPorts starts broken (but you simply have to upgrade to the actual Snow Leopard version). Visor only works on position Full-Screen. iStat Menus simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t. No support for GrowMail yet neither. And everything else does, as far as I can tell.</description>

      <description>Reading my morning load of feed news, I spotted an interesting bit on the New York Magazine travel feed:
Of course, someone&amp;rsquo;s doing something wrong there, but I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s their usage of XML::Feed (my guess on what they are using since the generator tag is omitted), by not dereferencing that hash reference or trying to forcibly stringify it.
Of course that comes from the feed itself:
It&amp;rsquo;s awesome, and nothing new of course, that big publications and organizations are using Perl to process and offer data to users, but I find it always super cool when they make it so obvious :)</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s very sad when projects close down because of lack of financial interest on them. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that on very near projects to me in the last couple of years and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop getting me sad. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s tr.im, which was a nice URL shortening service.
They weren&amp;rsquo;t, of course, anything new, but it was really cool. They had a great short domain name and it just worked, plus they weren&amp;rsquo;t one of the shitty services like Twitter-whore bit.</description>

We spent way too much time dealing with the build for the pkg-ruby-extras build model than to the actual fixing and updating. At the end we came up with a very well updated and DFSG-compatible (in contrast to the one that Brightbox provides, which isn&amp;rsquo;t bad either to be honest) package for the 2.</description>

      <description>We got back from Spain yesterday. It was a nice overall vacation experience but a little too long for our own style and like, specially after spending two weeks in Mexico City. Lots of photos (at least some) are on our Flickr and some more on my TwitPic.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier to be back in New York.</description>

      <description>Given an awful work/travel schedule that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t handle in the last days, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get to Lisbon, Portugal to attend YAPC::EU, until today, day one of the conference, I was still looking forward to get a cheapish flight from Madrid, but it was just impossible, schedules wouldn&amp;rsquo;t match with my work and vacation plans. Bummer. Because of this, I will not be able to give my talk Perl in the Time of Social Networks (that I had already revisited and improved) there as it was expected for tomorrow.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll post more updates later, right now I&amp;rsquo;m trying to put my sh*t together and find my way through around here for the next couple of weeks. Interested people can always follow my microblogging feed too.

      <description>I attended YAPC|10 during this past week. The overall experience was quite particular, with ups and downs, but after all I made it back in one piece.
I rode a Greyhound bus on my crusade of saving a few bucks. I always had issues with buses, when I was a child I used to go from Celaya to Mexico City (and back) almost every weekend for a couple of years and I developed a phobia against the whole bus experience.</description>

      <description>I have a couple of accounts in Twitter (namely @debian and @planetalinux) that are starting to bring a lot of followers (well, at least some of them). And given that I consider these accounts to be Twitter-polite enough, I like to follow the followers back too; however, this task sometimes gets really hard and it&amp;rsquo;s tiring to go through the followers pages and follow those that I don&amp;rsquo;t follow yet over and over.</description>

      <description>The number of updates on my Twitter page kind of bothers me sometimes. It&amp;rsquo;s a reminder of the amount of time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent and wasted on Twitter, it&amp;rsquo;s an ever-itching mole in front of my face. However, I can cheat the system and society and still feel good about myself. What if I just remove all freaking replies I&amp;rsquo;ve made, except for those of people I do care about (like my fiance or Ruby Boobie)?</description>

      <description>During the last week, unbeatable Tatsuhiko Miyagawa uploaded Net::Twitter::OAuth to CPAN, which provides an awesome interface for Net::OAuth::Simple and Twitter by subclassing Net::Twitter. This way, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to develop Twitter client applications using its new OAuth method dropping the need for users to hand their credentials to third parties.
You will have to register your application on Twitter previously. You can do so here. If this is a web application that you will be building, you can provide a callback URL which is the page where the user will get redirected once she has granted access to your application.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a fantastic and exciting Perl summer.
During the last week, I received notification that the talk I&amp;rsquo;ve proposed for both YAPC::NA and YAPC::EU, was accepted.
I will be talking about Perl in the Time of Social Networks, which is mainly two broad things: how Perl can actively power a modern social networking site (I&amp;rsquo;ll be releasing a free -as in speech- social network website, similar to Lovd or RailSpace, built with pure Catalyst); and about high-load applications dealing with social networks&amp;rsquo; APIs and users (a Moose-based universal social network distributor), with Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, LastFM, and others.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m the only one that does something like this, but I certainly trust I&amp;rsquo;m not alone.
I love regular expressions (to which some people say there&amp;rsquo;s nothing regular about) and I just found TweetBeep recently, which is a simple alerts system. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing really new or innovative about it, given that you can get the results yourself using advanced search on Twitter and consuming the results from a feed.</description>

      <description>Rubx, also known as Ruby Boobie, is a nice spoiled girlie bot that runs on Twitter. She listens when you talk to her and when you do, it&amp;rsquo;ll better be with Ruby: She will interpret your tweet in Ruby and reply to you with what your code returns.
How does it work? You send a message to her: @rubx &amp;ldquo;The day I was born it was a &amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Time.local(1984, &amp;ldquo;aug&amp;rdquo;, 8).</description>

      <description>Or&amp;hellip; for those who care about Twitter and Debian :)
We&amp;rsquo;ve setup a Twitter account for the project to use on Twitter. Go follow it, go now! twitter.com/debianproject
Now, the interesting part about this is that any Debian developer with a GPG key on the Debian keyring can tweet to it. You basically only have to do something like this:
$ echo &amp;quot;Squeeze is scheduled for Winter 2014&amp;quot; | gpg --clearsign | lwp-request -m POST http://twitter.</description>

      <title>Regular expressions capturing in Java for Perl hackers</title>

      <description>Capturing is one of the more interesting things you can do with regular expressions, it gives you great power to get sub-strings out of strings with regex power.
I recently came up with the need to do it with Java. Having Perl background, you can understand how awful any other regular expressions implementation can be after been hacked with Perl&amp;rsquo;s, but it&amp;rsquo;s alright, it&amp;rsquo;s cool to learn.
Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s just simple, you want to capture Perl&amp;rsquo;s $0, $1, $2, etc, in your Java class.</description>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2009/02/26/googles-first-tweet/</guid>
      <description>Google created an official Twitter account. Its first tweet was something odd:
 I&amp;rsquo;m 01100110 01100101 01100101 01101100 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01101100 01110101 01100011 01101011 01111001 00001010
 I had previously written (in Spanish, for La Columna de Perl), how to quickly decode this &amp;ldquo;way&amp;rdquo; of binary writing with Perl&amp;rsquo;s chr and oct. So, to find out what was Google really tweeting, run:
perl -e &#39;map { print chr oct &amp;quot;0b&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Situation
You need to run a time consuming task after a PHP script is run. The task will have to reuse the POST/GET data that is being sent to the service. The task would have to be done once the client has gone away.
Solution
Use mod_perl&amp;rsquo;s PerlFixupHandler to take the POST data, set the handler to be run by mod_php (or whatever else you are running it). Finally, use PerlCleanupHandler to run that task since that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what that phase is for, once the client went away.</description>

The astrological confluence of 1234567890[0], the impending release of Lenny[1], and the odd sighting of a horned mythical beast that cryptozoologists are calling a &amp;lsquo;new FTP-master-assistant/slave&amp;rsquo; being sighted in the mist off the shores of the East River[2] will result in all emacs users to transcend and all vim users to be transponded to their respective motherships, which are scheduled for near-orbit on that night.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a very special case that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t spotted on Feedbag. Within the different methods that Feedbag uses to discover the feed on a given URL, the very first one is lookup on a table of &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; content types. If the alleged feed is served with any of the following content types, then Feedbag just returns that same URL as it assumes it&amp;rsquo;s the feed: @content_types = [ &amp;lsquo;application/x.atom+xml&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;application/atom+xml&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;application/xml&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;text/xml&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;application/rss+xml&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;application/rdf+xml&amp;rsquo;, ] However, what happens if the feed is not served with any of those but it&amp;rsquo;s a valid feed?</description>

      <description>OK, hopefully this might help someone some time somewhere. If you are getting the error on the title, it&amp;rsquo;s mainly because you are using a changed method on your ActiveRecord model.
I was working with an ActiveRecord model that handles an string with quotes, so when trying to save the model, that exception was raised. The problem is that ActiveRecord uses a changed method internally for all attributes that were modified.</description>

It was a great experience to get to know the west coast as we hadn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to come over. We also had the opportunity to meet with my great friend Marco Manzo, who is working for Leap Frog in the Bay Area.
On the MySpace side, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see that some real and good improvements are being made to open the platform as much as possible.</description>

      <description>After I spent time working on Apache2::EmbedFLV, I thought it was a good idea to do the same for audio files, specifically MP3 files.
So now that you have your MP3 files on your web server and they are accessible to the world, you may want to show them with an embedded audio player. Well, Apache2::EmbedMP3 is exactly for you!
EmbedMP3 uses the fabulous WP Audio Player, a small, elegant, GPL Flash audio player, similarly to how Apache2::EmbedFLV uses Flowplayer.</description>

      <description>Vitacilina, ¡ah, qué buena medicina!
A few months ago. Maybe more than a year, I started hacking on Vitacilina, which was meant to be the replacement for Planet on all countries Planeta Linux supports. I was doing well, I even hosted the code back then in Google Code. Later, I forgot about it, but I&amp;rsquo;d always been wanting to replace Planet with some homebrew solution for the Planeta Linux community. Anyway, that hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet.</description>

      <description>Situation
You have a bunch of Flash videos, FLV files. Every once in a while you dump new files on your publicly accessible Apache directory. You would like to give your users the ability to play those FLVs within a webpage you provide, instead of just serving them the files for a direct download. Maybe you want this for all FLVs, not only an specific directory.
Solution
Apache2::EmbedFLV!

      <description>I recently stumbled upon FeatherCast, a nice little project made by Rich Bowen and David Reid, the former, a recognized documenter within the Apache community, author of a few books on the webserver, mainly the Apache Cookbook. FeatherCast is an unofficial podcast; its primary goal is supporting the Apache Software Foundation community. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be greatly interesting, modern and up to date; more recently, bringing lights to some of the content and people, for instance, featured on ApacheCon, which took place in New Orleans, LA, late last year.</description>

      <description>As I tweeted yesterday, I received my new MacBook Pro. I was a bit skeptical on choosing this computer being a Linux user/developer for quite some time now. I thought it was worth giving it a try anyway. Besides, I still use my old Powerbook; as my home server since I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked the Mac hardware.

For the time being, I&amp;rsquo;m not running Debian in it, but I will install it sooner or later, for now, I&amp;rsquo;ve reached some stability and productivity on the current setup, I&amp;rsquo;m running MacPorts, which brings all the nice open source goodies to Leopard, Vimperator, TwitVim and all sort of terminal scripts to make Terminal.</description>

      <title>TwitVim: Nice Twitter client</title>

      <description>I do like Twitter. For quite some time now I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find a Twitter client that I&amp;rsquo;d really like. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried, lots of them, Twhirl, Twitux, microblog-purple (which I started to dislike since I&amp;rsquo;m not IMing that much anymore and it can become extremely annoying if not blocked), TweetDeck, etc. All of them don&amp;rsquo;t seem to fill my own needs and preferences. Even when Twitter used to support IM, I came up with probably the best solution I&amp;rsquo;ve used so far, GTalk on Bitlbee, so I could easily use Irssi with it.</description>

      <description>Wouter, I find your thinking on DebGem a bit overreacted. I think you are taking the product and commercial efforts that a company make as the proposed solution we&amp;rsquo;ve all been expecting for a similar problem, which is not. You are considering DebGem to be an outcome provided by the Ruby community, which is not, to this issue.
Phusion is obviously not the Ruby community, but part of it. How I see it, it&amp;rsquo;s great: I applaud that more companies take a look at nice technologies and try to provide their own products.</description>

      <description>Making a simple PerlResponseHandler that does something like this: sub handler { my($r) = shift; $r-&amp;gt;content_type(&amp;ldquo;text/plain&amp;rdquo;); $r-&amp;gt;print(&amp;ldquo;You suck.\n&amp;rdquo;); return Apache2::Const::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST; } &amp;hellip;doesn&amp;rsquo;t make what you&amp;rsquo;d be expecting. This is because mod_perl assumes, since you are specifying content type and something to print, that this is a legit and valid (200-ish) request. This is what you get:  POST http://myserver/resource &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 200 OK Connection: close Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2009 23:02:57 GMT Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8 Client-Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2009 23:03:00 GMT Client-Response-Num: 1 Client-Transfer-Encoding: chunked [ some headers snipped ]</description>

      <description>I make a lot of Web script processing, whether scraping, webservices, systems administration, etc. Because I sometimes happen to repeat small and useful chunks of code for different projects, I thought that, given making new modules and methods is usually hassleless in Ruby, I should make my own set of methods and goodies I constantly use. Example 1, I sometimes miss Perl&amp;rsquo;s LWP::Simple simplicity where I just pass a URL to a subroutine and get the content on a variable, quick, one-liner.</description>

      <description>Last week, I spent some time building a good (that I liked) feed auto-discovery tool to use in Ruby for other project I&amp;rsquo;m building, rFeed. I liked CPAN&amp;rsquo;s Feed::Find, and at some point I made a wrapper class to run a Perl script using such module, however, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy by mixing it all. So, Feedbag was born:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; require &amp;quot;rubygems&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; true &amp;gt;&amp;gt; require &amp;quot;feedbag&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; true &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Feedbag.find &amp;quot;damog.</description>

      <title>Two Git tips</title>

      <description>Following the Git tips being thrown on Planet Debian, here&amp;rsquo;s a couple:
1. Changing into a directory that contains a repo and shows you on PS1 what branch you are standing on:
 On .bashrc I have: GITPS1=&amp;lsquo;$(__git_ps1 &amp;ldquo;:%s &amp;ldquo;)&amp;rsquo; export PS1=&amp;ldquo;${GREEN}\w${RS} ${YELLOW}${GITPS1}${RS}\$ &amp;ldquo; 2. An alias I like to use on repos that are personal for quick tracking:
 [alias] &amp;hellip; log1 = log &amp;ndash;pretty=oneline &amp;ndash;abbrev-commit I hope you like them.</description>

      <description>My friend Marco first told me on IM, then I read it on PerlBuzz. The nice High-Order Perl book by Mark Jason Dominus is now available for free (as in free beer) at its website.
This book caught my attention a long time ago on a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble once, but since I had just too many book on queue, I decided not to buy it. I then read that it&amp;rsquo;s actually a good book on advanced techniques on Perl, so my interest grew, but for random reasons I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description>

      <title>DirectoryIndex and the &#34;perl-script&#34; handler</title>

      <description>Wouter Verhelst blogs about combining ScriptAlias (or a way to run CGIs) and DirectoryIndex in Apache.
Recently, developing a TinyURL clone I had a similar (not identical, though) issue.
Basically, I set SetHandler to perl-script on the &#34;/&#34; location, which basically means, everything accessed on a given virtual host, is affected. Because you are changing the handler for the entire location, DirectoryIndex will have no effect on it because mod_dir is the one dealing with the DirectoryIndex function, that is, using the DIR_MAGIC_TYPE handler.</description>

      <description>Aunque en realidad la gente no da gracias y es un hecho meramente histórico, la celebración de thanksgivin&amp;rsquo; me hace reflexionar al respecto de a quién y por qué daría gracias.
Dicho lo anterior.
Le doy gracias a Dios por hacerme feliz. Por tener la mejor mujer del mundo, la mejor familia, los mejores amigos y una vida llena de sueños, anhelos y esperanzas. Le doy gracias a Dios por colmarme de amor, por bendecirme con una vida tan plena y completa como la que creo tener.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.  &amp;ldquo;De esta triste estancia en la capital de Colombia se rescata el que pudieron ver jugar al mítico Real Madrid contra el Millonarios.&amp;ldquo;

      <description>Una de las cosas más bonitas que puedes hacer gracias a mod_perl, son las PerlSections.
Básicamente con éstas, lo que puedes hacer es definir dinámicamente directivas de configuración de Apache y hacer cosas bien interesantes. Por ejemplo, recientemente, para Planeta Linux quería tener una sola configuración de Apache para los virtual hosts que son repetitivos dada cada instancia (mx.planetalinux.org, ve.planetalinux.org, gt.planetalinux.org, etc). Precisamente lo que quiero evitar es tener que poner una interminable lista de VirtualHost&amp;rsquo;s, así que lo puedo hacer con secciones en Perl (que son denotadas en cualquier archivo de configuración en Apache con &amp;lt;Perl&amp;gt; y &amp;lt;/Perl&amp;gt;):</description>

Aunado a ésto, algunos colegas y yo hemos iniciado un simple y sencillo grupo LinkedIn de Linux en México para que todos nosotros, profesionales, desarrolladores (y usuarios también, ¿por qué no?</description>

      <description>A lot has been said about the elections already. I just want to share my personal experiences about it. During the weekend, Tom invited us to his place in lower Harlem (we live upper Harlem) on 123rd St and Adam Clayton Powell Jr Ave, for Tuesday night. As Tuesday arrived, we didn&amp;rsquo;t see too many people too excited about it. Living in Harlem, we were pretty used to black people supporting Obama, so getting closer and closer to the elections, we didn&amp;rsquo;t feel people anxious.</description>

So, for the sake of encouraging others to join us on Saturday if you in the city (or the tri-state area, or beyond!), here it is, my personal list of tasks I&amp;rsquo;m willing to work on:</description>

Al formar parte del selecto grupo de administradores de Planeta Linux, siempre nos interesa sumar esfuerzos: No nos gusta pensar que hay proyectos que lo único que quieren es aprovechar el trabajo de los demás sin crédito, me gusta pensar en Planeta Linux como un proyecto que puede ayudar a muchos otros más a formarse reforzando la comunidad latinoamericana linuxera, engordándola, consolidándola, sin embargo, bueno, ésto no es lo mismo en la dirección opuesta.</description>

      <description>Leo con tristeza (pero entendimiento) que Patricia Mercado ha renunciado del Partido Socialdemócrata luego de los problemas que tuvo el partido al ser robado por corruptos y mafiosos que con putas chingaderas alejaron los verdaderos ideales de los sueños que muchos tuvimos al votar por el partido en 2006, dirigidos principalmente por esta mujer. 
Esos mismos ideales me llevaron a conocer a gente interesantísima cuando el proyecto Socialdemócrata empezaba a interesarse por las tecnologías libres, como a Andrés Lajous (quien también ha dejado el partido mas no las ilusiones) y a Benjamín Ubach a quienes les guardo un profundo respeto y amistad fraterna.</description>

      <description>El domingo pasado mientras caminábamos mucho por la ciudad, terminamos en el GameStop de Lexington y la 86 donde por fin pude encontrar un título al que le traía muchas ganas: Dragon Ball Z: Shin Budokai.
Lo compré por dos simples razones:  Tenía ganas de un título de acción de pelea. Como soy de la medianamente vieja escuela, Dragon Ball Z fue una de mis caricaturas favoritas de niño ;-)  El estilo de pelea es excepcional, las gráficas son meramente de caricatura, lo cual es bueno pues muchos títulos para PSP fallan miserablemente al intentar desplegar bien figuras tridimensionales con el mismo ritmo y velocidad que el juego que intentan construir.</description>

Bomberazo no es más que, diciéndolo planamente, un blog; pero lo interesante el respecto es que es un blog bien hecho y con un buen e interesante propósito: Dar consejos, tips y notas en general para hacer bien las cosas en el horrible ambiente corporativo.</description>

      <description>Recently, my BFF Wadita (here watching the horizon) moved to Vancouver, BC from Mexico City to continue his studies on 3D animation. In the last months he was producing a short film for his personal portfolio which was finally released: it&amp;rsquo;s called The Last Day. Even though (as he described it himself) it&amp;rsquo;s not Pixar-like animation, I really enjoyed it, it&amp;rsquo;s both melancholic and inspiring.

You can go to the film website and watch it on high and low quality with a bunch of neat resources.</description>

      <description>Conozcan a Coccinni:  De ascedencia italiana, Coccinni ha sido siempre muy listo y obediente. Desde pequeño hacía sus tareas, respetaba a sus mayores, no decía groserías y hasta tocaba el violín. Intentó aprender el piano una vez pero nunca lo pudo dominar.
Sus papás lo abandonaron en Nueva York cuando él apenas era un lechoncito pero poco a poco y gracias al gobierno porcino ha podido salir adelante y hoy en día tiene una carrera universitaria en tocinos y embutidos alternativos (es decir, no provenientes del cerdo).</description>

Ésto es una buena noticia dado que Raquel ya me dejará desvelarme en las noches otra vez viendo capítulos viejos de Sex and the City y Will &amp;amp; Grace que pasan siempre en CBS (o una de esas televisoras secundarias) a la medianoche. Sin embargo, hay algo que me gustaría comentar al respecto de las olimpiadas.
Ésta fue la primera vez que viví un evento de tal envergadura (qué palabra tan soez) fuera de casa, fuera de México.</description>

Recently, I bought a ticket for my mom to come to visit us in New York. She finally couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it for the dates we had picked so I had to cancel the airline ticket that I had already paid in Orbitz.</description>

      <description>Machu, what you posted recently made me recall how some local friends told me were treated upon check-in at Oaxtepec, where DebConf6 was happening. It was maybe four or five persons, including myself, treated with arrogance, indifference and rudeness when there were issues (or say, situations) with the rooms or something, by that Argentinian woman, who was the nice representative of the Orga team with the local venue.
UPDATE: Edited. Only posting bullshit now that I know about after madduck&amp;rsquo;s reply.</description>

      <description>Today, fifty years ago, my mother was born.
On July 24th, 1958, Vicenta Leyva gave birth to Olga Cristina Garza Leyva in the small town of Zumpango del Río (later renamed to Eduardo Neri), in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero. Her father Guillermo Garza, who is still alive, was a private pilot. Olga Cristina was named Cristina after the saint that is celebrated on the same day.
She was their third kid, a couple of years before Víctor and Guillermo were born and a couple of years after, Carlos was born, all of them being born on total different places on southern and central Mexico.</description>

      <description>Personal stuff coming up; if you are not that kind of person, please skip :-) I forgot to say on my previous post about YAPC::NA 2008 that while I was in Chicago, I had the really nice chance to meet Carlo Segre and Dirk Eddelbuettel and enjoy a couple of nice beers with them. Great guys! I&amp;rsquo;m probably not attending DebConf this year. It&amp;rsquo;s just too expensive right now and since sponsorship appears to be not enough, chances for me are quite low now.</description>

      <description>And this is the perfect example. While I had a wonderful position, my opponent failed by trying to checkmate me too soon, and it took me some time to figure out a way to mate him myself. I consider a bit disrespectful to take the queen out too soon. See the game here. No more PGNs for you.</description>

      <description>En una calurosa mañana de diciembre de&amp;hellip; creo que 2005, desperté. La noche anterior había soñado que tenía una muy bonita PowerBook y que era un feliz usuario de Mac. La idea me rondó por dos minutos mientras, recostado en la cama, decidía mi futuro tecnológico. Era perfecto, utilizando mi Mac y siendo todo tan hermoso, simplemente perfecto. Perfecto imbécil terminé siendo porque me paré de la cama, me vestí, me subí al coche (así es, no me lavé los dientes, ni me bañé ni nada de eso) y me dirigí al Lumen de Insurgentes.</description>

      <description>Cuando me pongo a pensar y dejar volar la mente imaginando cómo puede ser estar en un túnel donde cien personas empujan hacia una salida minúscula, trancada por la policía, siento una muy, aunque breve, incómoda desesperación. Imagina que te falta el aire; que por más que quieres zafarte de la multitud, no puedes; intentas abrir espacio, pero tus tristes brazos son impotentes contra el choque humano; la vista se te empieza a nublar, te sientes débil, te duele el pecho y los pulmones, sudas frío, sientes el sudor en el cuello y de repente lo dejas de sentir.</description>

      <description>So I attended the conference last week in Chicago, IL. I was just been procrastinating to write about this.
As a (almost) complete outsider of the Perl community, I have countered thoughts about the whole event:
 I was actually expecting a deeper technical content on some of the talks. Some speakers were just very bad at presenting, they were either boring with a very exciting topic or lacked the spark to get the audience attentive.</description>

      <description>Well, it is actually Iceweasel 3 for Debian testing. Iceweasel just hit unstable yesterday (it had been for a while on experimental) and if you are running testing and can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it to get through QA, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a backport for you:
 deb http://debian.axiombox.com/ testing main
 The newest xulrunner was also backported, which was, yes, the whole point for this.
UPDATE: Iceweasel 3 was uploaded a couple of weeks now, not yesterday :)</description>

It is a beautiful city, we walked on Boston Commons, Newbury St and got up to the Prudential Building, it was a quick visit. We also wandered around the MIT. Boston has the kind of charming touch you (or at least I) cannot find in New York City anymore.</description>

      <description>Una vez que una persona está dada de alta en Hacienda y puede expedir recibos de honorarios por actividades profesionales extras, como muchos de nosotros, programadores y desarrolladores que nos salen chambitas eventuales, nos topamos a veces con que no entendemos cómo es que se calculan bien las cantidades para los recibos de honorarios. Y a mí también me ha pasado mucho hasta que realmente me puse a estudiar al respecto (en realidad no, pero mi papá me echó la mano entendiéndolo).</description>

      <description>Recently I had to deal with POST requests on mod_perl 2 on a custom XML-RPC webservice server we have been developing and maintaining over the last year (we are actually moving it to REST some time in the middle future). It was time to move some of our base modules from a couple of CGIs to the power and muscle of mod_perl.
So, while dealing with POST requests (like XML-RPC is actually specified) I faced the issue that I wasn&amp;#8217;t being able to get the POST data on the PerlResponseHandler phase.</description>

      <description>So I wrote an entry on my tumblelog about what&amp;#8217;s going on with my life currently. Since Tumblr&amp;#8217;s feed doesn&amp;#8217;t get pushed immediately, I showed the post to my co-worker and friend Chris, before it hit the planets:
- So, yeah I have my blog since it&amp;#8217;s syndicated on Planet Debian and other small feed aggregators -I said. - But do they really care about your bike, your chess games or you attending that conference?</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a person who isn&amp;#8217;t satisfied with a lot of things. This both affects me and helps me on several circumstances in life, such it is.
The latter also affects my way to deal with mail, mail serving and MUAs. For years, I was a strong Novell Evolution user, mainly because it was quite easy to use, it was pretty and it used to understand the needs that people like me, involved in a lot of things (some of the worthwhile, some of them shitty), required.</description>

      <description>We took two days off and went home to see our folks, family and friends. Superb.
  The good: Mexico City at around 30C.  The bad: Getting a bit more exhausted than I usually am.   The ugly: MTA Subway. For real, ultimately, we cannot trust it anymore on our way to and back JFK. Ugly and sad.</description>

      <description>After a while, I ended up building WWW::Tumblr (implementing the Tumblr API), so that Blog::Normalize::Tumblr can easily replace scrapping. The interesting part would be to write small applications to interact with the WWW::Tumblr to handle your tumblelog. Only file uploads missing for now. For now.</description>

      <description>Recently, chatting with some folks on the TextMotion IRC channel, I started thinking on the places I&amp;#8217;ve lived my whole life. From the bottom of my mind, this is a rough list:
 Aragón, Estado de México, México. The house where my parents lived in when I was borned in August, 1984. 1984-1989.  Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche, Mexico. 1989-1992. Although I&amp;#8217;m not completely sure if we moved on the &amp;#8216;88 or the &amp;#8216;89.</description>

      <description>So, we&amp;#8216;ve finally came up with another personal project we&amp;#8217;ve been working on in the last couple of months: Historias de Nueva York. This is my formal introduction. This (yet another) Spanish spoken blog tells those unheard stories of us, Latinos (and others) immigrants, are experiencing on the Big Apple. Little, funny stories about just everything we see and hear, life experiences and anecdotes waiting to be told, from New York, NY.</description>

      <description>As it was expected, I moved from MovableType crazyness into Tumblr. Ha, so this is now a tumblelog (the world of Intenet sometimes amazes me :P).
And as it was expected I brough Blog::Normalize::Tumblr into life. Blog::Normalize is becoming a nice little toy I like to play with. My imported data came from MovableType which was came from Wordpress. Cleanly enough, I&amp;#8217;d be able to export Tumblr posts (or categories/tags or anything else in the future) into Wordpress again and that&amp;#8217;d be a nice circle.</description>

      <description>So, I have finally moved my blog to MovableType from Wordpress and a couple of interesting things have happened:
 I&amp;#8217;ve gave birth to my new blog, Infinite Pig Theorem. I&amp;#8217;ve started Blog::Normalize as an entirely i-don&amp;#8217;t-give-too-much-shit-if-people-disagree-so-beat-it-dude project. You can import posts to MovableType from Wordpress as the time of writing which was my whole purpose at first, but then expanded the idea.  It feels good to be back.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s incredible how one troll can split a channel up. It&amp;#8217;s incredible how the sexist shit can be spread all over the place. It&amp;#8217;s incredible, not wait, not incredible, it&amp;#8217;s sad, sadder and sadder, to see what Debian has become. The Debian social life has become a center for dramas of all kinds, since sexist traumas, transgenders issues, people with too much free time, real good technical people leaving, freaking big farts in Debian thinking on leaving the project, elitist dolls clubs, small wannabes who think they can treat other people unrespectful.</description>

      <description>Íbamos en el metro de Nueva York dirigiéndonos al hogar. Ella disfrutaba del nintendito que es novedad y es plenamente adictivo con varios cartuchitos. El trayecto subterráneo es de la W4 a la 145th, en la línea A o C, da igual. Se suben dos guaditas cualesquiera y se apean cerca de nosotros, agarrados de un tubo vertical, por un momento sus miradas se centran en el videojuego.

El domingo Raquel y yo hicimos una reunión con algunos de nuestros amigos en casa de mi mamá. Los invitamos a echar cheves y luego les invitamos pizza común y corriente. Lo lindo es que pudimos darles a los asistentes los regalitos que les habíamos traído.</description>

      <description>Este simpático personaje a veces intenta llegar temprano a la oficina. Temprano es antes de las 9 de la mañana, para así no tener pretexto e irnos a las 6 de la tarde (aunque ésto último casi nunca pasa).
Uno de estos últimos días llegué a la oficina y saliendo del elevador en el piso de la oficina estaba un mai repartidor, un wadita cualquiera, con una bolsa de papel en la mano y una nota en la otra.</description>

      <description>Fuimos rahep y damog a comprar comida cerca de la oficina. Generalmente lo más barato es ir a un deli, donde como en todos lados, mexicanos cocinan y preparan la comida. La chamaca se quedó en el cajero y yo me fui directo al mostrador de comida y vi los letreros para ver qué pedía.
- Next? Sir, what do you need? - Me preguntó un oaxaquita, un guadita cualquiera, del otro lado del mostrador.</description>

      <description>En este país nos podemos sentir a veces un poco fuera de lugar. Este fin de semana es una prueba de ellos; la mayoría de gente a nuestro alrededor van a sus casas a comer pavo y a pasarla con sus familias, agradecen por lo que tienen, etc. No toda la gente por aquí es como muchos creemos que son.
Yo hoy, y para variar un poco, quiero también dar gracias :)</description>

      <description>El simpático personaje que escribe en este blog ha olvidado de rasurarse la barba. Lleva sin afeitarse alrededor de dos meses. Aún cuando la barba no le aparece tan tupida como quisiera, tiene algo de espesa ya en estos momentos. Aunado a esto, este personaje no puede ocultar su latinicidad por su color de piel y de cabello.
Dicho lo anterior&amp;#8230;
Afuera de la oficina está un árabe en un carrito donde vende café, jugos (de botellita, no naturales) y una cantidad variada de panes y bagels.</description>

Caminaba este cándido personaje por la 8va avenida a la altura de la calle 155. Luego de peripecias en la indecisión propia de la mente del regordete y el sistema de transporte público neoyorkino, se encontraba a una cuadra de su hogar a las tres de la mañana.</description>

It was very nice and we had a lot of fun. I had the chance to tell Clint that some of his blog postings really intrigue me; I now feel relieved. Besides, I&amp;#8217;ve learned that boxing against Micah on the Wii is so tiring that even days after, my arms and back still hurt :-( We left at around 1:45 am.</description>

      <description>La función `map` de Perl es muy poderosa. O como diría entre cuates, *mucho muy* poderosa. Básicamente lo que hace es evaluar en un bloque, cada uno de los elementos de una lista. El día de hoy, en uno de los blogs que mi chava y yo (y otra bola de nacos por ahí de quienes estamos al pendiente) solemos visitar a menudo (porque es muy pendejo y nos gusta reírnos de vez en cuando), la escritora publicó un post con cadenas en binario (típico entre personas que quieren parecer interesantes usando truquitos que siempre han existido).</description>

Para arriba de Central Park se ve un río en diagonal, es el Río Harlem. Vivimos cerca de él, en la 8va Avenida y la 154th.

      <description>So, I have just installed RockBox on my iPod and I have liberated it :) It&amp;#8217;s nice to see people amazed on an iPod running something that&amp;#8217;s different from the usual firmware. Now, both my iPod and PowerBook are not running Apple software, muahaha!  Since we are in NYC now, and even before, we&amp;#8217;ve been looking for interesting activities in the area. Tomorrow, the New York City Perl Mongers will handle their monthly meeting.</description>

      <description>Este post tenía ya varios días que me lo estaba guardando.
Resulta que quedé de ir con Lurkan a su oficina en la Nápoles a filosofar un poco sobre la mierda en la que se ha vuelto la élite del CONSOL, algunos proyectos personales y sobre mi partida al vecino del norte. Como vivo en la Roma y él estaba en la Nápoles, opté por irme en transporte público, en lugar de sacar mi automóvil para luego sufrir para encontrar estacionamiento en su oficina y sufrir para encontrar estacionamiento al regresar a casa.</description>

      <description>La foto con Paco Ignacio Taibo II Originally uploaded by raquelydavidAyer, gracias a la invitación de Julio, tío de Raquel, nos lanzamos al Museo de Antropología, al cual creo que tenía alrededor de una década sin ir, a la presentación del libro El Cuaderno Verde del Che, compilación hecha por el fantástico Paco Ignacio Taibo II.
Paco Ignacio es mi escritor favorito. Cualquier persona que le guste ese tipo de narración chilanga, grosera, fina, sencilla, de comer pan con café en una cafetería en Bucareli, la coca cola, el misterio y el suspenso que sólo la Ciudad de México puede dar, debe leerlo.</description>

      <description>So, we will be moving to New York City, starting next week. We hope to spend a year there, but who knows, we might be there for only a few months, weeks, or more than a year! Life changes, that&amp;#8217;s why we are moving now, right? :) Only constant is change, isn&amp;#8217;t it?
Anyway, we are pretty excited about this. This has been something we have been expecting since May/June and we are finally ready to go, we&amp;#8217;ll see how it goes, hopefully good.</description>

      <description>La Columna.pl #3  Redirecciones  Bueno, el ofrecer disculpas por tardanzas tan prolongadas en la entrega de esta columna, ya se está haciendo costumbre, ¡y apenas van tres columnas! Por ahora mejor tomaré otro approach para las próximas liberaciones de la misma: Se harán nuevas entregas cuando estén listas. Un enfoque plenamente debianero.
Como sea, durante el mes pasado estuve principalmente preparándome, asistiendo y recuperándome de la Debian Conference que se llevó a cabo en las tierras del whisky, Escocia (pueden ver fotografías en mi galería).</description>

      <description>Manejo del tiempo con Perl  La Columna.pl #1 - Mayo 21, 2007.
Recientemente, por algunas de las necesidades que tuvimos en el trabajo, necesitamos manejar de alguna forma fechas y horas desde nuestros scripts y aplicaciones en Perl. Hace no-sé-cuántos años, los franceses propusieron un sistema decimal para manejar el tiempo, pero el método fue impopular entre la comunidad científica. Si hubiera sido así, manejar las fechas y horas en cualquier sistema, hubiera sido tan fácil que no habría tantas implementaciones para trabajar con él, como hoy en día.</description>

      <description>July 31st was my last day working for Sixbell-Nekotec Solutions (formerly known as Nekotec Tecnología). I lasted there three years. It seems like a life was spent there, heh: I entered after turning 20 and I’m leaving some days before I turn 23.
Our future is still a bit fuzzy, but we are working on it. In the meantime, I’m getting back full-time to Mathematics next 13rd. But if our plans succeed and if everything goes right, we’ll be moving by the end of August or early September.</description>

You really have to be one when, after all of that, you finally arrive and seat on your so comfortable chair and start blogging, working with free software or playing a movie on your iPod.</description>

      <description>So, my official training for DebConf8 has just started!
What is this training about? Well, since a couple of weeks ago, I had seen a little Argentinian restaurant two blocks from my place. It is not new to find Argentinian places on the area, specially on La Condesa, where lots of foreigns reside within Mexico City. Argentinians are known in some circles, because they usually take their dogs for walking on Parque España, Parque México and the neighborhoods nearby (not that Mexicans don’t walk dogs, it’s just a bit more stereotyped for Mexicans to put dogs on the roofs of buildings and not taking very good care of them).</description>

      <description>Yeah, we are almost two weeks back now, but until now I can feel we are done with lots of pending issues.  To summarize, I left DebConf on Saturday morning, arrived NYC on the afternoon where Raquel was waiting for me. By Sunday, we had the very nice chance to meet with abrotman, rcox and stew. We stayed at stew and rcox’s place until Tuesday, when we got back. We also had the chance to meet with people that we have been working for remotely.</description>

I leave my apartment in Mexico City at around 4:30 am. Raquel takes me to the airport. We both realize how we could not work properly without each other. Saturday, 1&amp;#160;pm. Arriving in New York City. Given the time and the stupidly long line for passport/visa control, I drop my plans of visiting the city.</description>

      <description>So, here I am in Jamaica, NY, near the JFK airport. Flyglobspan’s flight to Liverpool was cancelled and scheduled until next Monday. This simply sucks and I don’t have any energy left for flaming anybody, I just did it too much during the afternoon. Just as Christine, I shouldn’t have booked with this crappy company, due to my previous feelings about this. A lady was flying on Tuesday, and they rescheduled her itinerary to today, and they simply re-rescheduled now for Monday.</description>

      <description>Transcript of the call for participation on the Gathering of the Indigenous People of the Americas. If you don’t mind, feel free to skip it. Considering that 515 years after the first invasion of our ancestral territories, the war of conquest, the plunder, and capitalist exploitation have not altered their course, but rather have become a new war of extermination, a war designed for the destruction and utter plunder of all the original peoples of the Americas; Considering that the long history of wars of independence and numerous revolutions that have taken place on our continent have not yet changed the condition of colonized people, nor have they allowed for a full recognition of our rights in the nation states that formed in the last two centuries; Considering that despite a long history of domination, our resistance has sustained itself and that our people continue to live and struggle, and that this struggle has been encouraged by the uprising of the Zapatista National Liberation Front (EZLN) in the first days of 1994; Considering that the strategies of the national governments of the Americas have always sought the division of our people through the establishment of borders, reservations, and legislation designed to fragment us and to neutralize our efforts of autonomy; Considering that the strengthening and the unity of the struggles of liberation of the indigenous people of the Americas will be possible as our peoples meet and come to know each other; Considering that for our people it has proven necessary that their struggles be made known world wide in order to be supported by all honest movements that struggle for a society effectively just, free, and democratic; All indigenous communities, tribes, and nations of the Americas are called to THE GATHERING OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE AMERICAS</description>

Viajes largos han sido algo que me han dejado impactado en los últimos años. Como generalmente he viajado solo, tengo mayor oportunidad para pensar en muchas cosas, del trabajo, del amor, de la familia, pero también puedo observar a los demás pasajeros junto conmigo.</description>

      <description>I’m injured. Yesterday, Raquel and me were fooling around and playing, so in the middle of the play, I knelt down, grabbed her legs and put her lap on my left shoulder in order to lift her. So I did.
After carrying her and she screaming “put me down!”, I tried to avoid her from hitting some thing on the ceiling, so I bent to one side wildly, with her still on my shoulder and back and then I felt an awful jab and pain on my back and the whole thorax started to hurt.</description>

      <description>Pues luego de alrededor de 16 días, ya está por fin La Columna.pl #2. Ahora comento una pequeña herramienta que escribí para una de esas necesidades que a veces es necesario cubrir de alguna forma divertida nosotros mismos; el título de la columna es «Pequeñas herramientas para grandes necesidades». Dense una vuelta.
Por cierto que en esta ocasión me fue imposible incluir las correcciones que me hizo Marco Antonio, debido a que en los últimos días estoy en friega con varias cosas del trabajo.</description>

      <description>Holger’s reminder of the Towel Day made me remember an excellent quote from The Simpsons:

      <description>La Columna.pl es una columna que estaré publicando quincenalmente. Ella, inspirada por la gran cantidad de columnas de Perl que ha escrito Randal Schwartz, tocará diferentes temas y situaciones que principiantes o programadores en Perl pueden enfrentar y que yo personalmente también he enfrentado e intento explicar de una forma rápida, concisa y sencilla. Creo firmemente que, una vez digerida una curva pronunciada de aprendizaje, esa experiencia puede moldearse de tal forma que transforme la línea en lo más recta posible para gente interesada, para gente que desea conocer ejemplos de la vida real.</description>

      <description>I just booked and paid my tickets to reach Edinburgh next month and attend DebConf7.
I’ll be flying to New York on June, 16th through Delta from MEX. Then, I’ll go over the Atlantic with Flyglobespan, from JFK to Liverpool John Lennon Airport. From there, I’m still not completely sure, but I guess I’ll go by train to Edinburgh. Same way to return, on Sunday 24th, after spending a Saturday night in NYC.</description>

Hacemos como que trabajamos; nuestros jefes hacen como que nos coordinan y dirigen; hacemos como que queremos progresar en nuestros trabajos y ellos hacen como que quieren que progresemos. Hacemos como que estudiamos en la escuela y los maestros hacen como que quieren enseñar; los trabajadores de la universidad hacen como que trabajan, como que lo hacen bien; todos hacemos como que nos importa nuestro entorno, hacemos como que nos importan nuestros amigos.</description>

      <description>Hola,
 Este mensaje va dirigido a ti que intentaste contactar recientemente (de digamos, dos meses para acá) a alguien de Planeta Linux para que te agregue, cambie tu feed, agregue tu hackergotchi o algo similar. Este mensaje va dirigido a ti que no recibiste respuesta a tu petición. Antes que cualquier cosa, una disculpa. El mal manejo de la lista de correos hizo que muchos correos se traspapelaran y se dejaran al olvido, aunado a esto, muchos miembros del equipo de Planeta Linux parece que ya no están activos mas que para modificar sus propios feeds: ofrezco una disculpa a nombre de ellos, tomaré cartas en el asunto.</description>

      <description>POR EL DERECHO DE LAS MUJERES A DECIDIR
Al largo camino que han recorrido siempre las mujeres para ejercer sus derechos, hay que sumar el ataque persistente de quienes se consideran poseedores de la verdad absoluta, y tratan de imponer sobre ellas sus juicios morales empleando chantajes, amenazas, insultos y difamaciones. Ataques todos, en estos días, a la libertad de las mujeres que optan por interrumpir tempranamente su embarazo por decisión propia.</description>

      <description>Two weekends ago, Raquel and I went to see the RHCP at Foro Sol, on eastern Mexico City. She already blogged a bit about it (in Spanish).
It was fuckingly awesome. They still rock the way the have been doing it for so many years (no matter what abrotman or resiak say about them). A set of huge leds screens were put all the way through the stage and beyond. The sound was excellent for such a big place and they simply got the audience.</description>

      <description>Desde diciembre de 2004 soy un feliz usuario de hardware de Apple. En ese entonces adquirí una muy marica iBook de 12&amp;#8221;. En enero de 2006 adquirí una muy machota PowerBook de 15&amp;#8221;. Durante este tiempo, he usado muy poco el sistema operativo MacOS X que incluían en la máquina. La mayor parte del tiempo tenía dual boot entre Debian GNU/Linux y MacOS. Pero desde hace alrededor de cinco meses he venido usando únicamente Debian GNU/Linux.</description>

Antes incluso de que emigráramos a Cd. del Carmen y Celaya, respectivamente, mi papá me había metido a jugar béisbol en la Liga Anáhuac (allá por Valle de Aragón) a la tierna edad de 3, casi 4 años (en 1987, 1988).</description>

      <description>Imoqnarra acerca de su nuevo trabajo en la Ciudad de México.
Cabrones, neta: ¡Ya no queremos más gente en esta ciudad! Para llegar al trabajo lleva hasta dos horas y de regreso también (en día de tráfico pesado, pero ha llegado a tomar hasta tres y media), en un trayecto de menos de 15 kilómetros. Somos demasiada gente aquí. Ni nosotros mismos nos queremos. La gente del DF no quiere a la gente del Estado de México, ni viceversa.</description>

      <description>Esta semana volví a clases en la Facultad de Ciencias en la UNAM. También esta semana, desde el martes, se llevó a cabo el CONSOL en la FI.
El regreso a clases ha sido más que placentero: Ya extrañaba estar de vuelta en clases, despejándome un poco de las presiones del trabajo y dedicarme un poco a cosas que me gustan y me mueven.
El CONSOL despertó en mí sentimientos encontrados: Luego de mucho tiempo volví a sentir ese espíritu de comunidad, de amigos provincianos, de gente que no veo y con la que me gusta platicar.</description>

Apenas ayer me enteré de ésto cuando Raquel y yo estábamos viendo los debates nocturnos televisivos; es la frase del año: &amp;#8220;(Sobre el desafuero) &amp;#8230;tuve que retirarme y perdí. Pero 18 meses después, me desquité cuando ganó mi candidato.&amp;#8221; -Vicente Fox, presidente de México del 1 de diciembre de 2000 al 1 de diciembre de 2006.</description>

El DebConf7 se favoreció para Edimburgo, Escocia. No me gustó esa decisión: Yo quería que fuera en Sarajevo, Bosnia y Herzegovina. Pero eso supone mi personalísima opinión.

Creo que Opera es un excelente browser que implementa muchas cosas buenas y es fácil, sencillo y bonito. Por eso lo ocupo. Y además lo ocupo porque, aún siendo software propietario, ofrecen la posibilidad de bajar una versión en Linux, para PowerPC.</description>

      <description>MJ, in 3rd world countries, some things like technology, travelling or taking care of the environment are not a matter of choice, unfortunately. When some of the basic needs for humans to live are easily covered and people do not have to worry about, suchs as daily eating, it&amp;#8217;s way more easy to develop a country and have people concerning about unimportant stuff. Even free software is a luxury matter on some countries!</description>

      <description>La semana pasada fue mucho muy pesada para mí. Entre la guardia, los proyectos que tengo en la chamba, Ulteo y otras cosas, he quedado exhausto. De cualquier forma, durante la semana estuve revisando algunas cosas de Planeta Linux, y entre ellas he tiránicamente decidido en vetar a una persona de Planeta Linux.
Desde luego, que puede no ser gran cosa este hecho ni para la persona del blog, ni para Planeta Linux, pero siento que los usuarios se deben una explicación.</description>

      <description>Here it&amp;#8217;s a top-10 list of really important things, created by Médicos Sin Fronteras in Spanish. directhex, from #debian-offtopic (thanks!), provided a grammar/spelling check on my original English translation.   Central African Republic: Resurgence of the conflict. In 2006, its civilian population was a victim of violence again. During these months, confrontations have taken place between government troops and rebel groups. Civilians, suspected of supporting one or the other, have stuck in the biddle.</description>

      <description>From The New York Times:
 CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 10 — President Hugo Chávez was sworn in to a new six-year term at a ceremony here on Wednesday in which he described Jesus as &amp;#8220;the greatest socialist in history&amp;#8221; and pledged to speed Venezuela’s metamorphosis into a Socialist country.
&amp;#8220;Fatherland! Socialism or death, I swear it!&amp;#8221; Mr. Chávez yelled as he was sworn in and given the presidential sash and a golden key to the tomb where the remains of Simón Bolívar, the South American liberator, are interred.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve also started to look for the best plan to reach Edinburgh next June.
I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll fly directly from Mexico City, since I want to visit Paris (in spite of my previous and only experience with CDG back in 2005 :-P) and then visit a nice friend in Bilbao. Then I could fly from there to Edinburgh or some place nearby with a cheap flights airline. Quick searches throw an estimate of 1&amp;#8217;150 USD for the trip MEX-JFK-CDG-JFK-MEX on Delta.</description>

El viernes por la mañana, Raquel, Janeth y yo salimos de la ciudad con rumbo a San Cristóbal de las Casas, donde nos proponíamos pasar las fiestas de fin de año. Terminamos dando el rol por Tuxtla Gutiérrez, San Cristóbal, las cascadas de Agua Azul, Villahermosa, Minatitlán y algunos otros lugares.</description>

      <description>These are my ten wishes for 2007. Since Santa didn&amp;#8217;t arrive in this part of the world, I think I&amp;#8217;m asking this to the Three Wise Men (in spite of they were brought here by the Spanish catolicism, but hey):  Dignity, land and respect to the Mexican indigenous groups. Return and good health for Commander in Chief, Fidel Castro. Strongest antineoliberalism in the Latin American region. Right wing oppression brought down in Bolivia.</description>

      <description>On his recent (and first) visit to Ecuador, Richard Stallman interviewed with elected president Rafael Correa. Stallman spoke about the benefits and advantages that free software would bring to Correa&amp;#8217;s administration. Some of the Ecuadorian free software community members were present and they reported that Correa listened to Stallman for like 20 minutes without replying. Then they agreed on freedom issues and had a conversation where they agreed on everything.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll be attending The Killers&amp;rsquo; concert tonight. I&amp;rsquo;m not completely fan of their synthesized-rock-indie music, but she likes them so much and she made me dig their last album, Sam&amp;rsquo;s Town, like a thousand times in the car; so I acceded and bought the tickets online. She was even jealous of a friend who is also attending, heh :)
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy at all since they are still a more or less new band, they only have two albums released and prices for tickets were high as hell (ironic), but her surprise smile worth it, it definitively does.</description>

      <description>(Translated from my same post in Spanish) A few days ago, McDonald published a cartoon on the end of the dictator Pinochet. FINOCHET (fin meaning &amp;#8220;end&amp;#8221;). Damn heart, it had to be on the left. Yesterday, fascist dictator Augusto Pinochet died in the Military Hospital in Santiago, after heart and lung diseases, being 91 years old. Now, current president Michelle Bachelet, a moderate socialist, in case Pinochet is given State memorials, could be attending the ceremony (in a predominantly conservative country as Chile), even after she was tortured and persecuted under the dictatorship and his father was murdered under the regimen, after serving Salvador Allende&amp;#8217; government.</description>

      <description>Hace unos pocos días, McDonald publicó un cartón sobre el fin del dictador Pinochet.  El día de hoy, el dictador fascista Augusto Pinochet muere en el Hospital Militar de la capital chilena, luego de padecimientos en el corazón, de 91 años. Ahora Michelle Bachelet, actual presidenta socialista moderada de Chile, en caso de que se le den funerales de Estado a Pinochet, podría llegar a asistir (en un país predominantemente conservador como Chile), aún cuando ella misma estuvo presa durante la dictadura y su padre fue asesinado bajo ese régimen, luego de servir al gobierno de Salvador Allende.</description>

      <description>El 8 de diciembre de 1980, John Lennon fue asesinado por Mark David Chapman afuera del Dakota, su residencia en Nueva York. En los últimos años de su vida, John e irónicamente Yoko, protestaron contra la guerra y se convirtieron en mensajeros de paz en el mundo. Qué cosas que a veintiséis años de su muerte, sus ideologías antiviolencia sean aún vigentes e igual de ignoradas por guerras, hambre y miseria en el mundo.</description>

      <description>I have to congratulate my Venezuelan buddies for making a nice and democratic reelection for President Hugo Chávez, last Sunday. Venezuela confirms again that is a grown, mature and social-oriented country.
Fight continues. And after Ecuador elections, a couple of weekends ago, more and more social democracy has been made in Latin America, after the win by the leftist Rafael Correa. Another strap. We cannot forget neither the Nicaraguan elections in early November where sandinist Daniel Ortega won.</description>

      <description>Does anybody know of some nice and clean way to send my information on songs played on my iPod (5.5G in my case) to Last.FM? It seems that most of the apps around require iTunes (like iSproggler), but I&amp;#8217;d love to do it with a simple script run on a console (and the iTunesDB propietary binary files happens to be a PITA).
Because of lack of time, if nothing exists on that at the moment, I&amp;#8217;d be glad to offer a bounty for such app.</description>

      <description>Desde el día de ayer ya es oficial que Felipe Calderón es el nuevo presidente de México. En los últimos días he pasado por un análisis personal de la política del país y he llegado a la conclusión de que todo esto es pura mamada.
El Peje no es tan pobre diablo como muchos pueden llegar a creer (y como yo lo creí mucho tiempo). El Peje representa la conciencia de México, representa (ojo que digo representa y no digo que lo sea) la conciencia política y democrática.</description>

      <description>Tuve la oportunidad de escuchar el nuevo disco liberado bajo la firma de The Beales y de Apple Records, intitulado Love. Originalmente, la música había sido mezclada y producida para un espectáculo del Cirque Du Soleil, pero como el resultado fue tan bueno, George Martin, productor del disco (y quien también ha producido la mayoría de los discos de los Beatles), decidió comercializarlo. El disco es exquisito. En realidad es un remix de los mismos temas que hemos escuchado de los Beatles en los últimos cuarenta años, pero el resultado es excelente, además de que el audio es stereo de dos canales, además que tiene mezclas surround en 5.</description>

      <description>Hoy terminé de leer la novela escrita a cuatro manos, Muertos Incómodos, de Paco Ignacio Taibo II y el Subcomandante Insurgente Marcos. La novela está dividida en capítulos, aquellos nones fueron escritos por el Sub y los pares por Taibo II; se publicó originalmente de diciembre del 2004 a febrero del 2005&amp;#160;en entregas dentro de La Jornada.
Tengo que decir que es un texto que me encantó y me quedé con las ganas de que nunca acabara.</description>

      <description>Los Pumas de la UNAM han concluído una exitosa temporada el día de hoy. Y digo exitosa porque, luego de varios torneos cortos mediocres, en éste pudo lograr no sólo escaparse un poco del asunto del descenso si no también meterse a la liguilla (playoffs) y más aún, terminando como 2do lugar en la tabla general.
El día de hoy, los Pumas dieron una probadita de lo que les espera a los demás equipos repasando a los Tigres de la UANL por cinco goles.</description>

      <description>He pecado.
Durante varias semanas y meses, me hice a la idea de que mi computadora no se llevaba bien con Linux. Y me forcé a usar MacOS. Más por obligación que por gusto. Me retiré un rato de Debian, argumentando que le pondría más atención a otras cosas como la escuela o el trabajo. Llegó un momento en el que me volví el novio favorito de la piratería: Me coquetaba a cada rato, lo que quería lo bajaba con un torrent con el cliente propietario de BitTorrent.</description>

      <description>Found at the Mexico City House Hash Harriers mailing list :) 
A man and a woman who had never met before, but were both married to other people, found themselves assigned to the same sleeping room on a transcontinental train. Though initially embarrassed and uneasy over sharing a room, they were both very tired and fell asleep quickly&amp;#8230; he in the upper bunk and she in the lower.
At 1:00 AM, the man leaned over and gently woke the woman saying, &amp;#8220;Ma&amp;#8217;am, I&amp;#8217;m sorry to bother you, but would you be willing to reach into the closet to get me a second blanket?</description>

      <description>El día de mañana se juega uno de los partidos más importantes de la temporada, en donde los aguerridos Pumas de la Universidad se miden contra las Águilas del América. Desde el lunes por la noche, ya tenemos los boletos. Igual y sí se ocupan los 114&amp;#8217;600 asientos del estadio, qué emoción :-)

Y este va por la Universidad: ¡Goya, goya! Cachún cachún rará, cachún cachún rará, ¡goya, Universidad! </description>

      <description>El día de hoy hice el examen quizás más cabrón que me ha tocado en la Facultad, y es que conjuntó varias cosas que me lo pusieron muy cabrón. Explico a continuación.
No suelo estudiar. No tengo tiempo o me da mucha flojera o invento pretextos para no hacerlo, pero bueno, una de las cosas por las que estudio Matemáticas es porque prefiero entender algo y chingarle a eso. Es más fácil para mí entender cómo se realizan ciertas operaciones o problemas (así nomás problemas porque sí, no como los ingenieros que sí tienen una causa para estudiar matemáticas :) ) o más recientemente, entender cómo demostrar un teorema que agarrar un libro y ponerme a estudiar, leerlo y hacerle al pendejo de que estoy entendiendo.</description>

Asimismo, en la Facultad vi una propa de Bocafloja, ¡yeah!

Tú, pinche jodida prieta color de llanta (eufemismo: morena), lánzate a Europa pues allá te espera un pinche güerote bien guapote, para ti que sólo piensas en sexo todo el día con alguien diferente a la bola de horribles gordos bigotones mexicanos.</description>

      <description>El periodo vacacional que he tomado en Debian, me ha llevado incluso a replantear los canales de IRC que frecuento últimamente:  FreeNode  #lidsol. Por que me gusta estar con gente involucrada en el software libre dentro de la UNAM y me divierto con las guerras entre la Fac. de Ingeniería y la Fac. de Ciencias. :-D #debian-offtopic. Paso ratos increíbles y he encontrado buenos amigos ahí. #perl. Me encanta el IRC porque siempre hay canales con gente en movimiento, incluso en altas horas de la noche, y este es uno de esos canales; siempre con información, recursos y material de todo tipo, obviamente alrededor de Perl.</description>

      <description>1 - 1&amp;#160;Luego de un flojo primer tiempo, los Pumas salieron en el segundo tiempo siendo el equipo que siempre hemos querido que fuera: Ofensivo, buscando variantes, fuerte en la defensa. Lástima que no pudieron la vuelta al marcador y tuvieron que conformarse con un empate que, en casa, sabe a derrota pero con sabor a buen juego y con mayores esperanzas de salvarse del descenso y colarse a la liguilla.</description>

      <description>Tato, Raquel and me headed to Cat Power&amp;#8217;s concert last Wednesday. Luckily, I won two tickets for the concert on a morning radio show (it was around 6 am, so when the speaker asked a question, I had plenty of time to open my notebook, confirm the answer on Wikipedia and call the station; because of the time, the call entered quite quickly, on the 3rd try). It was a double, so Tato had to buy his own ticket.</description>

      <description>Demostración por obviedad&amp;#8220;La demostración es tan clara que no necesita ser mencionada&amp;#8221;
Demostración por acuerdo general&amp;#8220;¿Todos a favor?&amp;#8221;
Demostración por imaginación&amp;#8220;Bueno, pretenderemos que es verdad&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;
Demostración por conveniencia&amp;#8220;Sería muy agradable que fuera cierto, así que&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;
Demostración por necesidad &amp;#8220;Más le valdría ser cierto, o la entera estructura de las matemáticas se retorcería en el suelo&amp;#8221;.
Demostración por plausibilidad &amp;#8220;Suena bien, así que debe ser cierto.&amp;#8221;
Demostración por intimidación &amp;#8220;No seas estúpido; desde luego que es cierto.</description>

      <description>Un día como hoy, 13 de septiembre, pero de 1847, los Niños Héroes defendieron el Castillo de Chapultepec de la invasión norteamericana.
Pero como la puta historia siempre es engañosa desde cualquier punto de vista, pues también esta historia de heroísmo tiene sus tintes de falasia.
¡Los Niños Héroes no eran niños! ¿Hasta cuándo se les hace que un niño deja de ser niño? Según la Wikipedia, se toma hasta los 15 años, pero bien puedo dar ejemplos de &amp;#8220;niñas&amp;#8221; de menos de 15 años que no son para nada niñas, ¡son cualquier puta cosa menos niñas!</description>

      <description>Pues he decidido tomar un break en mis actividades en Debian, que es algo que invariablemente ya había venido realizando en las últimas semanas. La razón principal, como se lo he comentado a allegados a mí, es que por el momento tengo prioridades diferentes a las que tenía en meses y años pasados. Esas prioridades se resumen a la universidad, el trabajo y mi salud física y mental.
Por el momento he dejado huérfanos todos mis paquetes no comantenidos, si les interesa alguno, echen un ojo a la lista, no sin antes verificar en los archivos de debian-devel si es que alguien lo apartó.</description>

      <description>Pues ayer hubo una tocada en Las Islas, en Ciudad Universitaria.
Quería ir, pero no pude porque tenía que venir a la oficina si quería quedarme a estudiar mañana (neta :P). No recuerdo exactamente el nombre del masivo que hubo, pero fue para promover la democracia y el pedo del voto por voto del PRD, del cual abundan militantes en la UNAM, como es bien sabido. Finalmente eso es completamente irrelevante y equis pa&amp;#8217; mí, pero hubo buenas bandas, Salón Victoria, Antidoping, Santa Sabina, Botellita de Jerez y la Maldita Vecindad.</description>

World metros I have taken: Got at b3co.com! So, Helsinki (Finland), Madrid (Spain), Porto Alegre (Brazil), Mexico City (Mexico), Caracas (Venezuela), Guadalajara (Mexico) and Valencia (Spain).
I guess people living in countries where it&amp;#8217;s easier to travel between each other, may have caught more metros :) </description>

      <description>ALTERNATIVA INVITA Foro: &amp;#8220;La transición en riesgo: retos y oportunidades&amp;#8221; El conflicto postelectoral es la oportunidad para repensar los marcos y reglas del juego de nuestra democracia.
La transición en México se ha desarrollado en varios momentos y el de hoy plantea grandes retos y oportunidades. Desde los espacios de deliberación es posible construir una agenda que nos permita marcar la ruta para visualizar instituciones y leyes que funcionen mejor en un México plural y diverso, que reclama ser escuchado.</description>

      <guid>https://damog.net/blog/2006/08/26/respeto/</guid>
      <description>¿Por qué la gente aboga y clama por respeto cuando claramente se insulta elegantemente al pedirlo? ¿La gente realmente merece respeto cuando se pide? ¿No el respeto se gana? ¿No el respeto es una cosa mutua? Quizás si te encuentas en la posición de solicitar respeto, quizás realmente no lo mereces porque también falta respeto de tu parte hacia la otra parte.
Lo que puedes terminar haciendo es simplemente insultar, ofender y denigrar a las personas con un escudo y capa de solicitud de respeto.</description>

      <description>Recientemente me ha dado por grabar algunos videos desde mi celular. Luego de echar a andar el bluetooth en la laptop, pasar fotos, música y videos desde el celular se hizo muy facilito. El problema fue que el LG Chocolate graba los videos en un formato 3GP, que mplayer, por ejemplo, sí puede reproducir, pero sin audio.
Googleando un poco y metiéndome a la lista de correos de mplayer, encontré que hay que recompilar mplayer agregando el códec AMR.</description>

      <description>Pues Alejandro Bárcena me extendió una amable invitación a participar en el Debian Day que están organizando en Torreón, Coah, en la Comarca Lagunera, el próximo sábado 19. 
 Si los detalles de último minuto salen bien, estaré dando la charla titulada «Conociendo a fondo el proyecto Debian», donde se tocan aspectos organizativos y se muestra cómo es realmente por dentro el proyecto. Cabe mencionar que esta es la primera vez en mi vida que pisaré alguno de los estados fronterizos del norte, y aunque no podré estar mas que unas cuantas horas en el lugar, espero que todo salga fino, fino y disfrutar la estadía :) </description>

      <description>Mucha gente me pregunta sobre lo más chido que vi en mi estancia en Venezuela. Lo más fino y chido y hermoso y sobresaliente fue un material inédito que José hizo el favor de presentarme. Tunayt, de The Caracas Sound Machine, es una canción con alto fervor nacionalista y belleza interior, enaltece el sentimiento del venezolano que todos llevamos dentro :) Aquí pongo el link para que bajen el material y lo escuchen, y la letra para que lo canten:  The Caracas Sound Machine - Tunayt</description>

      <description>El CONSOL 2006, ante mi propio escepticismo, ya está aquí, y se celebrará en las instalaciones del Instituto Politécnico Nacional, del 15 al 18 de agosto. Es cierto que yo tuve muchas dudas acerca de la realización del congreso y más, estando por fuera, pero ahora sólo me toca desearles un gran éxito y que ojalá salgas las cosas tan bien como siempre nos salieron.  Esta es la quinta edición del congreso, y la segunda vez que se realiza en el IPN.</description>

Hice un pequeño experimento y no le dije a nadie que era mi cumpleaños y fui anotando las personas que me felicitaron :-). Finalmente no deja de ser otro más de los acostumbrados egotrips. Por orden alfabético he aquí la lista:   Ana. Me llamó a las 00:00 del 8 de agosto. Gracias, preciosa. Te amo.  Andrés.

Este festival se ha convertido en uno de los más importantes eventos alrededor del software libre y Linux en nuestro país, y me da gusto volver a él dos años después. En ediciones anteriores, el festival se realizó en la ciudad de Guadalajara, Jalisco, y desde el año pasado se lleva a cabo en Puerto Vallarta, una de las ciudades más hermosas que nuestro hermoso Oceáno Pacífico nos regala.</description>

Las oficinas de Alternativa se encuentran en la calle de Palermo, en la Col. Américas Unidas, muy cerca del cruce de la Calz.</description>

      <description>He recolectado una cantidad enorme de anécdotas en el último par de años debido a los viajes que he hecho al extranjero, que, aunque obviamente no son muchos, he podido recolectar muchos recuerdos y memorias inolvidables sobre muchas de las cosas. De éstas, podría contar muchas, de verdad, muchas; muchas, incluso que quizás nunca le cuente a alguien por ser demasiado banales, estúpidas o muy personales, o quizás simplemente por falta de tiempo, por güeva o por no darle la suficiente importancia.</description>

      <description>Ayer fue el día electoral en México. A diferencia a como se realiza en algunos países latinoamericanos, en México se lanza una sóla elección cada seis años, y se convierte en presidente aquel que tiene más votos, no importando si es un voto más, o si no alcanza mínimamente cierto porcentaje de votantes, etc.
Las casillas cerraron, en todo México, a las 6 de la tarde, hora local (hay que recordar que en México se presentan tres zonas horarias: -0800&amp;#160;en Baja California y Sonora; -0700&amp;#160;en Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Sinaloa y Nayarit; y -0600&amp;#160;en el resto del país, centro y oriente.</description>

      <description>Recently, a proposal by Alejandro Ríos was made in debian-devel-spanish to provide a Debian planet in Spanish to syndicate blogs from developers, maintainers and contributors in that language.
After working a bit (and after my trip to Cuba), we are able to show this to the public. I wish more people contributing with Debian writing blogs in Spanish, could ask their addition by writing to the mailing list; we are only 10 persons there so far.</description>

      <description>Pues desde hace un par de años, he estado haciendo puros rayones que me gusta llamar Cofratiras, porque el Pop me dió chance de publicarlas en Cofradía. Este pequeñísimo sitio servirá para recabar todas las ediciones que han sido publicadas de ella. Ojalá este sitio algún día tenga thumbnails o alguna de esas cosas mafufas. El enlace a las notas de Cofradía contendrán principalmente los comentarios vertidos de los cofrades a cada de las tiras (y podrán encontrar, quizás, mucho mejores ediciones de las tiras que las que yo guardo aquí).</description>

Ya pronto pondré un texto mucho mayor sobre lo que me tocó ver y vivir con respecto a Debian y al software libre en La Habana (que finalmente no pudo ser mucho, desafortunadamente), pero por lo pronto, pongo las fotos que tomé, aquí.</description>

Recuerda que la decisión que tomes es muy importante para ti, para tu familia, para el futuro de México. Algunos dicen que debes hacer un voto útil. Votar por el menos peor o para que no gane otro. Dicen que desperdiciarás tu voto si sigues tus propias ideas. Los políticos de siempre, no contentos con querer eliminar a quienes no somos como ellos, quieren que abandones tu modo de pensar, tus convicciones.</description>

      <description>Me permito transcribir aquí el texto Entre Venezuela y Nadalandia de Eduardo Galeano, publicado en Página/12, de Buenos Aires y rescatado en Patria Grande, sitio de cultura latinoamericana por Héctor Velarde.  Entre Venezuela y Nadalandia. Por Eduardo Galeano. Extraño dictador este Hugo Chávez. Masoquista y suicida: creó una Constitución que permite que el pueblo lo eche, y se arriesgó a que eso ocurriera en un referéndum revocatorio que Venezuela ha realizado por primera vez en la historia universal.</description>

      <description>Ya puedo decir que tengo 5-examenes-de-admisión. Hay un antes y un después. Ya no puedo envejecar más. Voy a iniciar Matemáticas en la UNAM de 22 años. Si no paso el examen en esta ocasión, ya no habrá futuro para mi en la UNAM, ya no insistiré más, y tendré que hacer otra cosa, tomar otro rumbo más estable. 5-veces-después incluye también conocer y utilizar Linux, conocer Debian y transformar mi manera de pensar.</description>

      <description>No hay nada que sienta con más intensidad, excitación, ánimo y amor en el mundo del fútbol que ver a tu selección nacional anotar un gol en una copa del mundo. Ya decía Javier Solórzano que el fútbol es lo más importante de lo menos importante, y sí, desde luego, pero qué hermosa es esa parte menos importante de nuestra vida, es un deleite, es lo que le pone una cereza al pastel, lo que le da el toque maestro a nuestra cotidianeidad.</description>

      <description>Well, Mexico played three preparation games in Europe on their way to start the World Cup. They played against France and the Netherlands on their territories and well, I think Mexico was not ready enough, it is not solid and the manager was making lots of crazy movements. They ended 1-0 and 2-1, respectively. Obviously those were difficult matches against fútbol potences on their home, but still Mexico has plenty of capacity to beat any of those countries.</description>

      <description>I commented Joey, on DebConf, about an idea on bringing Debian-News.net news syndication into the front page of the Debian Wiki, on some similar way as Wikipedia displays current news on their main page. After thinking a bit more on the idea, and after actually receiving a green light on the Debian Wiki BOF, I thought it would be better if we could include more than only one feed, so we could include more Debian-related news sites, like Debian Administration, DebCentral, etc, as well as some other official feeds like the DSAs or the DWNs.</description>

      <description>Un problema de razonamiento matemático.
Tres niñas de Comunicaciones de la Ibero están tomando cafés Capuccino Latte en el Cubo (cafetería central de dicha universidad). Al pedir la cuenta, el meserete les indica que por los tres cafés son 25 pesos. Cada una de las chamacas, abriendo su bolso Louis Vuitton pone 10 pesos, es decir, entre las tres ponen 30 pesos. Como sobran 5 pesos, cada una toma un peso de vuelta, y los dos pesos restantes los dejan de propina.</description>

      <description>Just as Tore said: &amp;#8220;This is the best DebConf ever&amp;#8221;. Isn&amp;#8217;t it great?
I started really enjoying this DebConf once I stopped worrying about bullshit, once I stopped worrying about senseless things and started to really give a shit about almost anything. Why do I have to worry about the DPL giving a shit or not on the Latinamerican Debian community, even after being invited to meet the guys or to attend our BOF?</description>

      <description>After the start of the DebCamp I&amp;#8217;m just pissed off about just everything. I don&amp;#8217;t know if that&amp;#8217;s because people could expect you to do something you aren&amp;#8217;t supposed to do; or because people are just trying to do children pranks and only look like adult morons; or because I&amp;#8217;m just exhausted of children urinating in the pool; or because of the heat; or because I&amp;#8217;m supposed to handle all the jokes about Mexican food; or because of having to go to school everyday; or because of having to skip my classes; or because of missing Ana, missing Venezuela; or because of the fact that I won&amp;#8217;t be able to get the money I&amp;#8217;m spending on DebConf back; or just because every fucking thing around me.</description>

It seemed to me DebConf5 happened last week or something and we are now facing the Mexican DebConf in a couple of days. :D
Last months have been passing quickly, events and people around me are being completely appreciated and loved from my part. And now DebConf is here.</description>

      <description>Pensar en las cosas hacen que tus acciones, muchas veces poco adaptadas y meditadas, surjan y controlen todo lo que haces. Un recuerdo, un momento, una flor que queda marchita en el pavimento. Siempre está presente el hubiera. No es posible que de alguna manera dejaría todo por una sonrisa sincera.
Muchos de nosotros llevamos dentro un suicida.
Preferimos los vicios que los sacrificios.
Preferimos sentirnos más que mucha gente, creer que eso lo hace a uno muy cabrón, y lo único que pasa es que lo hace a uno una peor persona.</description>

      <description>Caracas es una ciudad súmamente curiosa y divertida, hoy me pasaron dos cosas interesantes :)
Iba camino a Fondafa para encontrarme con José y Ademar pero tenía antes que pasar al Ministerio del Interior y Justicia a recoger unos papeles. Salí de la estación del metro Parque Carabobo y telefoneé a Manuel para que me orientara pero no atendió, luego llamé a José y me dijo que caminara hacia el norte, hacia el Ávila, hasta llegar a la Av.</description>

      <description>Creative Commons México ha lanzado una iniciativa donde busca fomentar la creatividad y la originalidad en trabajos que sean liberados bajo alguna licencia de Creative Commons en el marco del Primer Concurso de Creatividad Mexicommons. Las categorías abarcan música, video, animación y podcasts. Los premios quizás no sean los más espectaculares (aparte de contar con el honor de mostrar tu trabajo en iSummit de CC que se llevará a cabo en Brasil) pero creo que la promoción que esta iniciativa puede provocar en el uso de licencias abiertas y de uso común, es bastante alentador y motivante para nuevos desarrollos intelectuales creativos, que día con día, se ven más como una realidad en nuestro país con el potencial de artistas y creadores.</description>

Hace más de un mes, tres hermanos junto con su chofer fueron secuestrados por un grupo de maleantes quienes montaron fuera de su casa una alcabala disfrazados de policías. Ayer se anunció que fueron encontrados todos muertos en un lugar del estado Miranda (según entiendo, que forma parte de la zona metropolitana conocida como la Gran Caracas).</description>

      <description>Pues desde la semana pasada algo me pegó muy duro en el estómago. Generalmente sufro de gastritis, a veces me duele mucho la boca del estómago (por lo cerdo tragón que llego a ser) pero esta última semana yo creo que me excedí y de verdad recaí bien gacho.
El viernes del FLISOL, por la noche, me sentí muy mal del estómago, estando en San Cristóbal. Ana y mi suegra me cuidaron muy bien, gracias a ambas, no se merecen menos que besitos :) Por ende, no pude dormir bien esa noche y llegamos al FLISOL el sábado hasta pasado el mediodía (por si acaso alguien se preguntaba remotamente porqué llegamos tarde ese día).</description>

Con ese dinero, Manuel me acompañó al supermercado Cada a comprar algunas cosas para tenerlas en casa de José. Compramos varias cosas interesantes (lo siento, no hay fotos :() y decidimos hacer una cena mexicana (intentamos llamar a José y a Susana a sendos teléfonos celulares para avisarles que no cenaran, pero ninguno atendió :().</description>

Ana me invitó a estar aquí en el FLISOL y vine para estar con ella, sin embargo, lo que veo a mi alrededor es algo sumamente fastidioso y algo por lo cual nunca estuve envuelto realmente en ninguna actividad del FLISOL, ni del año pasado, ni de éste.</description>

      <description>Pues como este fin de semana José salió de fin de semana a no-sé-dónde y Ana tenía que quedarse en casa estudiando para un examen que tiene el lunes, me quedé todo el fin de semana en casa, al menos lo que va de él, siendo ahorita las 5 de la tarde del domingo.
Asalto en motocicleta. El jueves por la noche salí de Merkurio hacia casa alrededor de las 9 de la noche, José estaba un tanto preocupado por que aparentemente ya no eran horas para caminar (cabe mencionar que el camino de Merkurio a casa son quizás 500 metros, al menos menos de un kilómetro, entonces queda bastante cerca).</description>

      <description>Hola. Desde las alturas del piso 19 del Centro Comercial Los Chaguaramos en Caracas, capital venezolana, reporta David Moreno Jr.
Gracias a todos los que se preocuparon por lo de los tipos de migración de Santo Domingo. En especial gracias a Luigino por hacer de mi caso todo un reportaje en su blog (y que eventualmente apareció también en Aporrea). Gracias a todos los que han dejado mensajes de apoyo en los comentarios del post.</description>

Es un poco largo el texto, pero ruego a mis cuates mexicanos y mis panas venezolanos que lo lean hasta el final.
Aquel día salí con rumbo a San Cristóbal, Táchira, para visitar a Ana y pasar el fin de semana allá.</description>

      <description>Pues desde ayer empecé a jugar un poco con WWW::Mechanize, a sugerencia de José. Pretendía parsear las páginas de wallpapers de DeviantArt para obtener uno de ellos de la sección de favoritos para colocarlo como el background de GNOME en su llave de GConf. Alguna vez había ya hecho algo similar, como se podrá recordar con Poxole en diciembre de 2004. De cualquier forma, empecé a jugar un poco y a seguir jugando linduras con Perl.</description>

      <description>OK, pues debo una reseña en este blog sobre mis primeros días en Venezuela. Hace exactamente una semana que estoy aquí. Ana, José, Manuel y Diego, un cuate de Ana, fueron a recogerme al aeropuerto y vinimos a Caracas para desayunar. Desde entonces he comido muchas cosas diferentes y divertidas. Me he quedado en casa de José, donde me han tratado super chido, no podría agradecerles lo que han hecho por mí.</description>

El día de hoy me entero que:  El cabrón va a dar un concierto libre en el Zócalo Capitalino en pleno Centro Histórico, en la Ciudad de México el 26 de marzo. El cabrón va a dar un concierto libre en el Poliedro, en Caracas, Venezuela, este viernes 3 de marzo.</description>

Ustedes saben quiénes son. Algunas de las cosas que he hecho en estos últimos días:
Manu Chao. Pues el viernes pasado fui con el MiG a ver a Manu Chao en el Palacio de los Deportes, un espectáculo increíble, bailé y bailé y sudé y sudé y nunca creí darme cuenta de cuán refrescante puede ser una cerveza cuando estás sediento, bañado en sudor y con un calor de locos.</description>

      <description>Ayer fui con mi papá al Estadio Olímpico Universitario a ver a los Pumas de la UNAM jugar contra el Unión Atlético Maracaibo, equipo venezolano, compañero de grupo en la Copa Toyota Libertadores.
En el partido de presentación de los Pumas, allá en Uruguay contra el Nacional, habíamos caído por 2-0. Ahora, en la presentación de los Pumas en la Libertadores estando en casa, perdimos. No puedo creer eso. Si eso nos pasa con un equipo como Maracaibo que encontró el gol por suerte y que se defendió a más no poder, no quiero pensar en el desempeño del equipo con otros más grandes sudamericanos.</description>

      <description>Una de las bonitas cosas que tiene la burocracia en este país es el trámite de pasaportes. Salí de mi casa alrededor de las 10:20 de la mañana, mi mamá me echó un ride a la oficina de la SRE de la Delegación Benito Juárez. Llegué con todo listo, incluso fotocopias de mi CURP, fotocopias de mi credencial de elector, etc. Un tipo malencarado me recibe y me pide mi hoja de pago en el banco, mis fotocopias del pasaporte anterior y mis fotografías.</description>

Me acuerdo que hace un año estuve viendo las imágenes de los tatuajes de Debian de Amaya, de Mooch, de Billy, etc. ¿Qué me iba a tatuar? La espiral de Debian. Hoy hace un año empecé con la idea. Un año después heme aquí, con el tatuaje de la espiral a 8 meses de habérmelo hecho.</description>

      <description>Leyendo la bitácora de La Otra Campaña (sitio que no visitaba desde hace como un mes) vi que cambiaron la imagen de cabecera. Antes se mostraba una imagen del Subcomandante Marcos en la motocicleta que está utilizando para visitar todo el país y ahora pusieron el arte, no sé quién lo haya hecho, de una serie de pingüinos bien chidos, que bien podría hacer pensar que el EZLN está promoviendo el uso de Linux :) La figura del pingüino ha sido acuñada por Marcos y la Comisión Sexta debido a que el Sup suele viajar con un gallo con las patas lastimadas o deformadas, lo cual representa a la gente por la cual el EZLN lucha.</description>

Hey, DPL, do you approve travel expenses for me to visit Iran or Somalia?</description>

Hace un par de días, el periódico La Jornada publicó conversaciones del empresario Kamel Nacif con algunas personas, en su red de corrupción (éste es acusado junto con otro hijo de puta llamado Succar Kari) y pederastia, la cual fue descubierta por la escritora Lydia Cacho.</description>

La semana pasada, luego de regresar de la casa de la abuela de Joss de ver el Super Bowl, me pasé a la librería Gandhi dispuesto a gastarme un dinero en novedades :-P Dos libros me cautivaron, uno de ellos, sobre economía y política internacional: China, la trampa de la globalización, con una interesante portada (ya sé, pero de cualquier forma los libros de hoy en día en las librerías llaman tu atención por la portada y el título, en vez de que por su verdadero contenido) de chinos en una fábrica de manufactura, o algo así.</description>

      <description>Pues luego de haber ido a hacer el ridículo a Uruguay el pasado miércoles, el día de hoy, en casa, en el glorioso Estadio Olímpico Universitario, los Pumas de la UNAM le pudieron ganar a los Tiburones Rojos del Veracruz que estuvieron ampliamente descompuestos. Dos goles a cero.
Lo notable fue que Héctor Moreno, uno de los integrantes de la selección mexicana de fútbol sub-17, actual campeona del mundo, jugó en la zaga universitaria realizando un destacado desempeño.</description>

      <description>Pumas es uno de los tres equipos mexicanos que juegan en la Copa (sudamericana) Libertadores, junto con los Tigres de la UANL y las Chivas Rayadas del Guadalajara. El día de hoy jugaron su primer partido contra el Nacional de Uruguay, en Montevideo. Miguel España, director técnico del equipo de mis amores, no sé por qué, hizo un par de movimientos en el cuadro titular, que desde mi punto de vista, son un chingadera: No meter a Leandro Augusto desde el principio y no poner a Sergio Bernal como arquero.</description>

      <description>El 5 de febrero de 1917, el presidente Venustiano Carranza promulga la Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos en la ciudad de Querétaro. Casi 90 años después, cuando algunos grupos consideran que esa constitución es un tanto vieja y obsoleta para los tiempos modernos, se proclama el día siguiente hábil, hoy, lunes 6 de febrero, día festivo. Ojalá todos los días fueran como hoy, en que no hay casi nadie en las calles, el tráfico es estúpidamente amable y se siente uno sin mucho estrés.</description>

Ésta fue la cuarta jornada del Clausura 2006, y aunque los Pumas iban invictos en los tres primeros partidos (con una victoria y dos empates) el día de hoy se mostró su total inhabilidad para jugar correctamente al fútbol al caer 3 goles a cero contra un equipo en peligro de descenso.</description>

Luego de bostezar, le pareció que la planta en cuestión se estremecía. Le extrañó y se acercó un poco más a la planta, concentrado. Parecía que los pelitos de la hoja se levantaban notando la presencia de aquel individuo.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;#8217;t signed the petition for abrotman to come to DebConf6, sign it now! We are still 13 votes behind of our goal. Here is a picture so you can think on friendship :)
DebConf6&amp;#8217;s abrotman petition, only 13 votes left! (and he thought, at the beginning, the petition wouldn&amp;#8217;t get any vote, but mine :P)&amp;#8230; </description>

      <description>Desde hace varios años, el foro Skavoovie ha sido un lugar donde muchos nos reúnimos para platicar e intercambiar opiniones sobre el ska en, principalmente, México. Sin embargo, en los últimos meses el foro estuvo bastante apagado, principalmente por la apatía y por que mucha gente se empezó a separar del grupo. Por esta razón, Nacho y el Muerto, principalmente, se dieron a la tarea de organizar una fiesta-toquín con el nombre &amp;#8220;Recordando viejos tiempos&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Pues el día de hoy fui a la embajada americana por primera vez en mi pueril vida. La cita estaba fijada a las 8 de la mañana, por lo cual llegué a las 7:30. Para mi sorpresa vi un mundo interminable de gente, había muchísima gente: Personas de traje, señoras pedorras sintiéndose chingonas por que van a Estados Unidos, hipsters, niños fresas, pero también mucha gente humilde, sombrerudos, viejos y viejas, señoras gordas que llevan banquitos, viejas estúpidas que no paran de hablar y poner nervioso a todo mundo.</description>

      <description>¡Finalmente encontré mi pasaporte! :D
Aunque nadie es tan güey para perder un pasaporte, sí lo dejé en un lugar bien pendejo. Ayer llegué de la oficina a la casa y mi mamá me ayudaba a buscarlo, finalmente no lo encontramos en ningún lado, hasta que me dice: &amp;#8220;¿Y en la gabardina que usaste en el vuelo?&amp;#8221;. Vamos al closet, busca la gabardina y verifica las bolsas de adentro y ahí estaba el chingado pasaporte, burlándose de mí dentro de la gabardina, el muy puto.</description>

DO IT NOW!
Alexander Brotman is a nice guy from Philadelphia, US, who is unsure on coming for DebConf6 since he feels he doesn&amp;#8217;t fit the nature of the event. He is a great supporter of the Debian community and he shouldn&amp;#8217;t miss the chance to have an official DebConf so near from home. Besides, he is my friend, think on the kittens :&amp;#8217;)</description>

      <description>Pues bueno, gracias al gran interés que había entre muchos amigos del área de software libre, Planeta Linux está de vuelta, ahora de una forma más estable. Ahora con nuevo dominio, intentaremos darle una mejor administración con más confiabilidad. Además de Planeta Linux México, he creado Planeta Linux Venezuela que ojalá crezca tanto o más que el correspondiente mexicano. Así, bienvenido nuevamente, el planeta que ha sido siempre imitado, jamás igualado :)</description>

      <description>Ya sé. A nadie le pasa. Nadie es tan estúpido como para perder su pasaporte. Me lleva la chingada, la más grande de las chingadas. Finalmente sacar un pasaporte en México es bastante fácil y rápido (lo puedes tener listo en dos o tres horas), sin embargo lo que me preocupa es que el pasaporte que perdí es el que tengo registrado para la entrevista en la embajada gringa para sacar mi visa.</description>

Sus comentarios en este bonito y nuevo manejador de contenidos son ampliamente recibidos y ampliamente agradecidos. Justo ahorita voy saliendo con rumbo a la Legión Americana (que muy a pesar de sonar tan gabacho y militar, es, al menos donde nosotros estamos, un bar bien agradable donde la chela, el chupe y la bebida son bastante baratos), a disfrutar de una bonita noche con Toño y compañía.</description>

      <description>I just told my boss. I&amp;#8217;m moving to Venezuela. It&amp;#8217;s now official. Everybody knew, except for my boss and he supports me completely: He rocks. Well, it somewhat depends on the definition of &amp;#8216;moving&amp;#8217;, but I&amp;#8217;ll be there for more than a couple of months, call it whatever you want.
I&amp;#8217;m pretty excited. Time to get tickets. And time to plan actually, again, going to DebConf, which is, from an specific point of view, quite funny .</description>

Estaba esperando comentárselo al jefe mayor de Nekotec, y finalmente se lo he comentado. No me queda más que agradecerle cuán amable ha sido él conmigo, le agradezco todo el apoyo que me ha dado y que me dará con esta aventura.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s actually a bit funny to find some differences on the behaviour of people in other countries. I missed Paul&amp;#8217;s post about, between other things, fire alarms. It&amp;#8217;s funny how we act ourselves on the office when the fire alarms sounds. The very first time it actually sounded it was a peaceful and quiet day at the office. I don&amp;#8217;t remember exactly what I was doing since it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter. Suddenly, the alarms started flashing and making a light blink, together with a noisy sound, there it was the fire alarm.</description>

      <description>Just as lots of people I know, in December I bought a PowerBook (yes, I know, don&amp;#8217;t bitch me about the new MacBook Pro). It&amp;#8217;s a 5,6 actually. The day I bought it, I brought it to work and installed Sarge on it. After a while, I installed MacOS when, from the inside, it started to make a slightly hearable beep on random intervals. Suddenly, I figgured out that the installation went completely slow (it took about 4 hours to install MacOS).</description>

Cómo me emputa lo que la gente hace con una máscara enorme de hipócrita para hacer lucir las cosas de una forma en que no son.</description>

Siento que crecí como persona. Fui nombrado Desarrollador Debian. Me di cuenta cómo quiero dirigir mi vida. Pude hablar abiertamente con mis padres. Cumplí la mayoría de edad en todo el mundo :)   Pude comprar una buena computadora portátil.</description>

By night, we went to my end of the year workdudes dinner. On Saturday, we went with Tacvbo to Celaya and returned quite late, by midnight, to a friend&amp;#8217;s party. On Sunday we enjoyed the whole day by doing nothing :) and in the afternoon, we went with Polo and Eunice to get some Christmas presents to a mall.</description>

 Desde que tú llegaste, Mi vida es un desmadre, Siempre que estoy contigo Se me olvida lo que quiero decir.
Desde que me tocaste, No puedo concentrarme Todo el tiempo estoy pensando en ti.
Desde que tú llegaste, Me siento en otra parte, Estoy insoportable
Mis amigos se aburrieron de mí.
Es muy complicado, No importa que me esconda
Siempre algo me conecta a ti.</description>

This is a very interesting moment towards the event next year for all countries. In spite of US complaints, Mexico was considered head-of-group (thing that also took us by surprise), although we were 2nd on the region (I can&amp;#8217;t understand why we were 2nd since we had the same points as the US and we had more GF, which is the first criteria to undraw a tie).</description>

      <description>I was in Venezuela last week. Something special happened. No, it is not only that I was able to see my beloved girl; it is not that the free software community and free software efforts and project rock. No, something very personal and special.
I arrived at Maiquetía (roughly, international airport of Caracas) from Maracaibo around 9&amp;#160;pm. At around 10 or 10:30 I was on my way to the hotel on a van where they pick up and down people on the airport-hotel-airport basis.</description>

      <description>Pues por fin terminé la chamba que me había tenido tan ocupado en la chamba últimamente. Tardé dos semanas en acabarlo, con un código marranísimo (Perl irrestricto), pero finalmente hace la chamba. Si alguna vez tienen que convertir un R10 de ASN.1 de Ericsson a R8 basándose en IMSIs diferentes a los de Enitel y PCS (roamers) de Nicaragua y excluyendo aquellos que hayan marcado a números de emergencia, podrán encontrar mi script muy útil.</description>

      <description>En los últimos días, he estado bien ocupado con todo, principalmente con la chamba, tanto que luego se me va bien cabrón el avión intentando hacer cosas o darles la importancia que merecen, rápidamente aquí van algunas de las que me acuerdo:  Ana, te amo.  Ramón Carazo escribió una linda calavera , por la conmemoración del día de muertos, donde nos menciona a sus mejores amigos. Muchas gracias, de verdad que lo aprecio con todo el corazón.</description>

Y estás bajo mi control sólo yo puedo tocarte y puedo ahogarte en el vértigo del sadismo. No me importa morir, no me importa morir, en la oscuridad. Cuando no haya aire para respirar te estaré asfixiando, encadenada con mi foto condenada a pensar en mí.</description>

      <description>Hace casi ya dos años algunas de las personas a mi alrededor empezaron a criticar el hecho de que me gustara el ska. Yo me dejé llevar por eso e incluso, hasta cierto punto, empecé a cuestionar mis propios gustos, los cuales quizás sí eran una basura, pero finalmente a mí me gustaban. Acepto también que en alguna ocasión seguí muchas moditas tontas de las cuales ahorita, al mirar hacia atrás, veo que no fueron más que una búsqueda absura de identidad inexistente por el simple hecho de sentirme vacío.</description>

      <description>In most of the last few days, I&amp;#8217;ve been completely into NKjoom5, a framework for developing web applications for the company I work for. This is based on the lastest version of Joomla, 1.0.3, and it tries to bring more ease of use to the final product, capable of understanding by all the guys working on the Mexico and Colombia local officies of the company. In the meanwhile, I&amp;#8217;ve ported most of the core code of Joomla into mysqli extension of PHP5 and most of the XML functionality is about to be ported with DOM and even XPath, all of this to bring more accessibility to the code and bring future to present :) MySQL 5, for production systems now, is also used, but I haven&amp;#8217;t played with it yet.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking what would happen if I were born and living on the other side of the world. I began thinking on that while listening to the wonderful Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra. Would I enjoy that band as much as I do now? Would I be listening to some ska Latin bands and enjoying them as much as I do now? Would I enjoy ska as much as I do now?</description>

      <description>Ya le hacía falta a mi Palomita, de verdad que sí. El día de hoy llevé mi coche al moflero, debido a:  La llegada de la quincena, por que no tenía un solo clavo en qué caerme muerto. El periodo de verificación para coches con placas terminadas en 3 y 4 (mi placa es 753) termina este 31 de octubre. El moflero &amp;#8220;de confianza&amp;#8221; de mi papá está algo lejos, por allá por el Aeropuerto, la verdad es que me da mucha flojera pensar en ir hasta aquellos rumbos y me anima la idea de irme haciendo mis contactos de mecánicos y ese tipo de prestadores de servicios, cerca de mi casa (el mecánico que desdesbieló mi coche también está en los oscuros rumbos de Aragón, donde Tarzán perdió a Jane).</description>

      <description>No puedo hacerme pendejo y no ofrecer una disculpa a la gente de Puebla, pues no asistí al congreso ENLi , la semana pasada. Toda la cosa fue algo compleja. Resulta que mi plática se le traspapeló a los organizadores y no aparecí en el programa de actividades (pero sí en el afiche de propaganda ) si no hasta 2 ó 3 días antes de mi plática. El jueves decidí que iría a Puebla muy temprano por la mañana.</description>

No mañana: Hoy. Ya he enviado un ITP a Debian. Esperen el paquete para muy, muy pronto. En el mejor de los casos, para un paquete inmediato, lo subiré a experimental, pero si es demasiado inestable para experimental, lo subiré a un depósito no oficial.</description>

      <description>Hay veces que creo que ayudar en proyectos de software libre es una monserga. Por no decir una mierda. ¿La gente tiene una idea de todo lo que he hecho y por todo lo que he pasado para echar la mano en cierta forma a algo? Esto viene debido a que recientemente recibí una &amp;#8220;contribución&amp;#8221; a un bug de XMMS en Debian . La no muy amable persona se quejaba de que cambiase la carátula por default de XMMS de una forma muy poco &amp;#8220;polite&amp;#8221;.</description>

  El tubo del escape, que cruza todo el coche por debajo, está un poco zafado y suena como si trajera un garrafón vacío en la cajuela (pues se oye un poco más en la parte de atrás).</description>

      <description>Jesús Chávez was challenging Johnson&amp;#8217;s championship which he won in Italy against Steffano Zoff.
The fight between Johnson and Chávez was stopped on the 11st round by the referee to give Chávez a technical win. Johnson received around three bunches of punches in the last moments the fight without any answer from his side. The referee saw this and stopped the fight. Chávez was the new champion.
The referee and Johnson&amp;#8217;s crew asked him if he was OK and he said he was.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, when we arrived to his flat, he turned on the TV and there was a replay of the game on ESPN, so we saw the match was 1-1 in minute 60. Crap, 2&amp;frasl;3 of the game spoiled. Anyway, we saw the whole 60 minutes (with beer, without it it would have been impossible :)). After the 60 minutes, Real Madrid scored two times more, so they ended 3-1.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m doing this by exploring the logs on the bugs.debian.org tree, so the error margin is now much smaller.
I received several suggestions last week (the ones from doogie, m2 and others) that I will take into account with this closing.</description>

Cúlpenme si en Debian su XMMS de repente deja de funcionar o cosas extrañas pasan :-) Tengo entendido que en Ubuntu el paquete es el mismo, con mínimos cambios como las dependencias de ejecución y cositas así, pero finalmente utilizan el mismo paquete que en Debian.</description>

      <description>The most valuable Mexican boxing fighter, Julio C鳡r Chávez (106-6-1), fought yesterday on one of his goodbye presentations, on an event called &amp;#8220;Adiós Arizona&amp;#8221;, in Phoenix.
JC Chávez is not the same he was ten years ago. He&amp;#8217;s old (43), he&amp;#8217;s slow and lost last night&amp;#8217;s fight because of a broken hand in the 5th round. He&amp;#8217;s a complete shame, he represents exactly what a great sport player should not do when they reach glory: They should retire when they are in the top, so other cannot use them as stairs after to climb up.</description>

      <description>Today I have closed 729 work-needing and prospective packages bugs :-) 156 of them were ITPs and the rest 573, RFPs. All of them were bugs with a lifetime greater than 600 days old. Most of the ITPs closed were inactive bugs for more than almost two years. The RFPs were not consulted on this. Blame me if something went wrong with it. And please, do not complain about this: If people is still interested on their packages, they are free, as usual, to reopen them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working lately on trying to bring back the old debaday effort. Debaday was a little nice idea by Andrew Sweger writing a bit of one different and interesting Sarge package daily, started on March 2004. In Novembre 2004, his debaday blog died. Since January I&amp;#8217;ve been wanting to bring this idea back and last week I finally found some real time to do it. The new debaday: http://debaday.debian.net/. The hosting is kindly offered by the free comunity, nipl.</description>

      <description>Fútbol Andoni (a very nice Basque friend), Nere (Panamenian), Nayeli, me and others, went last wednesday to the Azteca stadium to see Mexico&amp;#8217;s game against Panama. Mexico had chance to qualify to the FIFA&amp;#8217;s World Cup since last saturday but they were completely humiliated at the Columbus Crew stadium against the US. It&amp;#8217;s a little bit sad to see how the US have improved their soccer level through the years (last time Mexico played in that specific stadium with the US, the latter lost 7-2, in the 70s) and the rest of the teams in the area haven&amp;#8217;t too much.</description>

Pónteme de frente, te pongo estos puños en los dientes. Y si alguien tiene algo conmigo, que tenga la valentía para intentar tocarme que yo estaré esperando acciones, no amenazas.</description>

      <description>El buen Beck tenía una frase en su weblog (en este momento parece que no está disponible) que me parece magistral, una de las mejores frases que he leído, y no sé si sea de él, o de alguien más.
 Si no estás siendo criticado, es por que quizás no estás haciendo suficiente.   Si se ignora tu trabajo, tus acciones, aquello que haces fuera del común diariamente, entonces no lo estás haciendo bien; no estás significando una diferencia en cualquier tipo de aspecto para otras personas.</description>

      <description>Llueve y llueve. Llueve y llueve. Creo que hoy fue el día en que se cayó por completo el cielo. Me perturba la lluvia y más cuando voy manejando. El día de hoy, al bajar de los altos bosques, tomé Observatorio. En cierto lugar, suele formarse un charco del tamaño de la alberca olímpica. La lluvia era tremenda, mis limpiadores son ya una basura y el desempañador nomás no desempañaba eficientemente.</description>

      <description>Entro a la interfaz de administración de mi sitio para escribir sobre cualquier cosa y de pronto aparece el zumbido insoportable de un grillo. Odio a los grillos. A Gunnar y a Paola le encantan, sobre todo cubiertos de chocolate o revolcados en chile piquín, ofreciéndolos a personas con los ojos atónitos al verlos deglutir tales insectos. El zumbido suena fuertemente, está bastante cerca. Estoy sentado en mi cama, con la computadora en las piernas y volteo inmediatamente hacia mi mueblecito donde está la tele y el estéreo: El sonido proviene de esa esquina.</description>

 In the next days, I&amp;#8217;ll be using some of the patches made available in the CVS for gparted. The version that&amp;#8217;ll hit unstable is raw 0.0.8.  fteqcc is the FTE QuakeC compiler, which between other things, will make possible for nexuiz to enter the archive. This was the first step to bring nexuiz officially to Debian. Being suscribed to debian-wnpp@lists.</description>

 Manejar. Manejar en la noche. Manejar lloviendo. Manejar lloviendo en la noche. No alcanzar a ver el pizarrón en la escuela. Darte cuenta de que tengo los ojos rojos más tiempo de lo normal. Mareos al ver tanto tiempo la pantalla de la laptop.</description>

And then back to Mexico City. The only country I would not visit in Central America because it is out of the route is Belize. I&amp;#8217;m getting excited because of this. I hope somebody would like to join me. I hate being alone when traveling.</description>

      <description>Actualización: Muchas gracias a los que han dejado un mensaje aquí y en el artículo de Cofradía. Gracias de todo corazón. Ya soy desarrollador oficial del proyecto Debian, luego de un largo proceso NM, de 14 meses. Podría escribir toda una lista de cosas sobre cuánto afecto tengo por el proyecto, por haber conocido tanta gente, por haber viajado a países que sin Linux o Debian jamás hubiera conocido. Estoy agradecido con la vida (cosa que me pasa muy poco a menudo en una depresión permanente de infinita tristeza) por las oportunidades que me ha brindado, y en este caso, con el proyecto Debian.</description>

Tato, one of my high school homies, will also be 21 on the 11st. I felt asleep on my own party last friday because I was too drunk (at 1:30 am).</description>

      <description>Mono Recientemente he estado inspeccionando un poco el profundo mundo de Mono, y parece entretenido: No daré opiniones más profundas, por que no estoy muy empapado aún. De cualquier forma, he encontrado un par de aplicaciones muy agradables para tener empaquetadas en Debian: Bless, un simple editor hexadecimal que parece tener muy buen futuro; y MonoUML, que es una herramienta para ingeniería de software asistida por computadora. Esta última, famosa por Mario Carrión.</description>

      <description>Me siento frente a la computadora (aunque bueno, es sólo un decir por que llevo ya sentado aquí cerca de ocho horas), abro mi fabuloso gEdit y planeo escribir algo para mi blog. La verdad es que nada me viene a la cabeza. Hay muchas cosas de las que me gustaría contar, pero simplemente no sé cómo traerlas de la cabeza (y algunas del corazón) a la compu. No sabía si escribir sobre mis amigos, de los cuales cada que me pongo pedo (tristemente) me doy cuenta (verdaderamente cuenta) de cuánto pueden llegar a valer; o de las cosas que quiero hacer y no hago, e incluso de las cosas que ya hago y que no me gustaría seguir haciendo.</description>

      <description>The roundtable/BOF in DebConf5 about Debian website was quite interesting, although I didn&amp;#8217;t participate much, but I was widely interested on listening to every opinion out there about it, since the website is one of my big concerns on the project. There, I proposed a navigation bar to be included on the header of each page, displaying the path you have followed, between the directories of the website (the webwml tree).</description>

      <description>Al momento de escribir estas líneas, me estoy yendo de Estonia. Justo ahora estoy viendo cómo el puerto de Tallinn se aleja de la vista desde el ferry o &amp;#8216;puto barquito&amp;#8217;. Estonia es un gran lugar, incluso más que Finlandia y su sociedad y actitud de primer mundo. Tallinn es barato, la gente es quizás igual de seca que la mayoría de Europa, pero se respira una mayor armonía aquí que en Escandinavia.</description>

      <description>Estoy en Tallinn, Estonia. Me conecto desde la red del hotel Radisson que, por una no tan módica cantidad de kroons (aquí no usan euros, como en la mayoría de este continente de mierda), me cobijó y me proveyó del servicio. Tomé el ferry de Helsinki a Tallinn a las 20:15 de ayer, domingo. Fueron tres horas y quince minutos. Cuando llegué a Tallinn y salí, era otro mundo, aún cuando están a escasos 200(?</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a very soft kind of ska, pretty romantic, made in Mexico City. If you are interested, grab it from here.</description>

Sólo puedo comentar que: No hables si no sabes, no escribas cosas por el simple hecho de tener dedos que te permiten hacerlo. No permitas que con otro comentario más, siendo anónimo, te llame pobre pendejo. Yo aprendí esa verdad de la vida haciendo lo mismo y siendo cagoteado varias veces por personas que me hacían deglutir enteras y completas verdades.</description>

      <description>The sun is hitting my back. I vaguely can see the screen. I&amp;#8217;m thirsty. I&amp;#8217;m too lazy to move to shadow. I&amp;#8217;m too lazy to go to the minimarket and buy beer or juice. I really miss some good food. I like people arriving to Helsinki from all over the world. Anibal has just arrived and he is with his bags in the reception. Holger has been in his chair for the last two days.</description>

I was thinking: &amp;#8216;My old man is now too old-fashioned for this time&amp;#8217;. He was completely right. I almost lost my Paris-Helsinki flight due disorganization on that airport, nobody knew what the gate was, or when the plane was leaving. When somebody told me I had to be at terminal 2D I was a running like a crazy, to not lose the flight, from a terminal to another.</description>

      <description>Estoy haciendo planes para que, al llegar a Helsinki, pueda hacer un viaje relámpago alrededor de la capital finlandesa. Mi ruta sería como la del mapa (hacer clic):
 Llegaré a Helsinki el miércoles 6 de julio, por la tarde, como a las 6 ó 7. Como seguramente llegaré muerto (ya me pasó al ir a Madrid en mayo), me echaré como tronco y seguramente amaneceré hasta el día siguiente. El día 7 inspeccionaré la zona (el HUT, que es donde nos quedamos), y el día 8 pretendo salir, como al mediodía, con rumbo a Tallin, Estonia, país que está situado al sur de Finlandia, sólo separados por el Golfo de Finlandia.</description>

      <description>Recently, I read on Jordi&amp;#8217;s blog (called Lawaloca, explanation in spanish) about Audioscrobbler. This is a music profile builder, which makes a nice webpage with the music you listen. You have to register in their website, download a plugin (official Debian packages for some of them are available) for most of the music players out there (including XMMS/Beep Media Player, Amarok, Rhythmbox and Windows/MacOS players), activate it by entering your username and password and that&amp;#8217;s all, start listening to your music normally.</description>

I just can&amp;#8217;t take life here anymore, and reading Amaya is leaving tomorrow for Helsinki; p2, Wouter and Holger (green hair!) already nearby; makes it only an anxious feeling to leave. Also, I called today Gunnar, since he was supposed to give me some shirts to carry to Helsinki (but he won&amp;#8217;t carry too many shirts, so he doesn&amp;#8217;t need my back (still hurts) anymore); he is leaving tomorrow (big fat lucky bastard :-*).</description>

Ésta es nuestra palabra sencilla para contar de lo que ha sido nuestro paso y en donde estamos ahora, para explicar cómo vemos el mundo y nuestro país, para decir lo que pensamos hacer y cómo pensamos hacerlo, y para invitar a otras personas a que se caminan con nosotros en algo muy grande que se llama México y algo más grande que se llama mundo.</description>

También William Vera (de Mérida, en la pierna) tiene uno, pero no encontré fotos suyas.

      <description>¿A qui鮠chingados le gusta que le cambien el nombre? Durante los casi veintiún años de mi vida me he llamado David Moreno Garza, eso es totalmente comprobable. Y con respecto a mi nombre, siempre han habido cositas que me cagan. Algunas cosas que me molestan en la vida:
 Los motociclistas zurcando las calles de la ciudad. Los motociclistas zurcando las calles de la ciudad sin casco. Los camiones que pasan junto a ti apestando a humo y que dejan una polvareda enorme a su paso.</description>

      <description>Me declaro un fanᴩco de los tenis Converse, sólo por ello tengo cuatro pares de dicha marca. A veces creo que tengo demasiados tenis y zapatos, haciendo un conteo mental rápido puedo recordar, de tenis (o zapatillas, como les dicen en Sudamérica) esos cuatro pares y dos pares más de distintas marcas cada uno. Además, tengo como cinco pares de zapatos y un par de chanclas. ¿Quizás son demasiados? Bueno, pero pasando a lo que realmente me compete en este post, hablaré sobre mis pares de tenis Converse.</description>

      <description>Ayer estuve presente en el Tercer Ciclo de Conferencias de Software Libre (CICOL) 2005, en la pequeña ciudad de Cuautla, Mor. El evento fue organizado por la comunidad local de usuarios y desarrolladores de software libre. Ésta es la primera vez que asisto a este ciclo, aunque ya había tenido dos certámenes en el pasado. Fue bastante agradable. Patrocinados principalmente por el Instituto Tecnológico de Cuautla y Dolric, es a todas luces notorio que hay mucho ánimo y ganas en la organización, existen los recursos (llevan a gente de muchas partes del país), quizá lo único de lo que carecen es de un mayor número de asistentes.</description>

      <description>El día de ayer, domingo de weba, me lancé a casa del Tacvbo, por que se nos antojaban unas chelas, y así de paso ese güey aprovecharía para pagarme cien varos que me debía. También era buen momento para darle los cigarros Fortuna que le traje de España, que aunque no tienen nada de especial, es chido fumar tabaco de otros países :-) Nos dotamos de cerveza, tres seises para los dos.</description>

      <description>Finalmente el Barcelona se ha alzado como campeón de la liga española. Para una reseña de los sendos empates de los azulgranas (con el Levante) y de los merengues (con el Sevilla) mejor lean los sitios de noticias deportivas reconocidos como ESPN Deportes, Marca o Lawaloca. ¿Por qué ganó el Barcelona la liga de mayor prestigio en el mundo? Por que se lo merecían, la neta. Luego de una lamentable temporada (mediocre) del Real Madrid, y el buen juego y la alegría de los campeones, se veía venir ya este triunfo desde hace un par de meses.</description>

      <description>Finalmente el domingo pasado regresé a México. Mi corta estadía (apenas una semana) en España fue suficientemente divertida y me ha dado nuevos bríos en la vida. Le agradezco de todo corazón a todos los que hicieron posible que cruzara el Atlántico y conociera el Mediterráneo (en la costa valenciana) :-) Volveré a estar por allá en julio, cuando vaya al DebConf5 en Helsinki. Y pues finalmente estoy en casa, esperando rehacer mi vida.</description>

I arrived 6 am, and by 9:30 I was already sleeping like a baby completely tired.The bad thing: I&amp;#8217;m now 7 hours older :-(The good thing: Right now, 7&amp;#160;pm is almost time to party and drink with the guys.</description>

Pregunté cuándo era la plática y me dijeron que dos días después, el miércoles. La verdad es que otro ponente (o varios, no supe bien) les cancelaron su asistencia y por eso fui requerido.</description>

      <description>Los Borgia (The Family) es una novela histórica escrita a cuatro manos por Mario Puzo (autor de otras obras magistrales como El Padrino y El Último Don) y su esposa Carol Gino. ¿Por qué escrita a cuatro manos? Antes de que Mario Puzo pudiera terminar la novela, murió de complicaciones respiratorias. Debido a ello, su esposa, quien fue su compañera por más de cincuenta años y quien conocía el trabajo y el arte de Puzo, concluyó la obra que estaba 90% terminada.</description>

Incluso, me parece que tengo logs desde hace dos años, principalmente, del IRC (usando X-Chat) y de los IM&amp;#8217;s (usando Gaim). Sin embargo, ahora quiero postear algo que interesante que pasó en el canal #debian-women, de irc.debian.org. Erinn, conocida como helix, al entrar hoy por la tarde al canal, me preguntó que si yo había editado su wiki.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8230;que soy un pinche desobligado. Tiene meses que me aterra esta confesión. Un ejemplo, le doy prioridad a trabajar en algunas cosas de Debian, en lugar de ponerle atención a mis clases. Prefiero hacer algunas cosas, en los últimos días, con Ruby/GTK, en lugar de ponerme a hacer la práctica de GTK+ que tengo que entregar la próxima semana. No sé por qué. Quizás por que siento que la práctica es completamente inútil, y que lo que tengo en mente con Ruby puede llegar a servir un poquito más (un simple cliente tonto offline para Mambo).</description>

Este evento, que ha juntado muchísimo interés por parte de las preparatorias en el DF, es organizado por el Área de Tecnología Electrónica, de la universidad. El sistema fue y está siendo desarrollado por el buen Antonio González, quien me comentaba recientemente que pretende liberar como software libre la primera versión del mismo (la usada el año pasado), lo cual suena estupendo :-) El CyberTest es algo un tanto sencillo.</description>

      <description>I finally found some time to update my RSS feed creator script and port it into Ruby. I have to say, Mambo is a really cool cms, but its feed creator sucks. So if you are wanting to generate your own RSS feed you can do it with this little Ruby script (yes, I know you can also do it with Perl, but Ruby is funnier :-):

      <description>La plática “Creación de paquetes de Debian” será celebrada el próximo sábado 19 de marzo, en punto de las 13:00 hrs, tiempo del centro de México, a través del canal #linuxpreview, de la red FreeNode (sí, la misma que di en el CONSOL pasado, pero por IRC ;-). Pueden encontrar más información por acá.
Lo interesante es que los chicos de LinuxPreview han estado realizando un estupendo trabajo con las pláticas sabatinas sobre software libre, y esta es la primera vez que presentarán (presentaremos) una especie de tutorial interactivo, explicando y demostrando con un ejemplo en tiempo real, el empaquetamiento de software en Debian.</description>

      <description>Semana de la Música de la Ibero, en los inhóspitos rumbos de las Lomas de Chapultepec.
Llegamos algo temprano (a comparación de cuando voy a otras fiestas) como a las 10:30 y empezamos a beber. La música no era buena, pura electrónica, sólo reconocí como tres rolas (Miedo, de María Daniela; Galvanize, de The Chemical Brothers y una de Michael Jackson). Y así se pasó la noche, viendo a una serie de chiquillos (principalmente gente de Comunicaciones de primeros semestres) embriagarse, con looks fresa-alternativo, faldas, polainas y gorras de trailero.</description>

      <description>blog debianoso, pero no por acá.
Pasando a otras cosas, creo que el día de hoy me voy a lanzar al Pasagüero, allá en el centro de la Gran Ciudad, a ver al colectivo Nuevos Ricos, y a su nuevo éxito, número uno, María Daniela y su Sonido Lasser. ¿Alguien gusta acompañarme? Dudo que Tato quiera ir, como habíamos quedado al principio.
Y como ya lo dijo Bernardo Sosa (excelente recomendación, gracias b3co), la canción de esta semana es Espiral, de Porter.</description>

      <description>Just in case you own an iBook (I don&amp;#8217;t really know if it is the same on the PowerBook machines) do not do the following.
If you are giving a talk and for some reason you have to close the lid of your iBook, do not leave the computer near to the projector&amp;#8217;s fan, where the heat is on fire.
My iBook has these little plastic things in the inside part of the lid, on the corners, in the top.</description>

      <description>CONSOL is finally over. Organization stuff has been pretty tiring this year. But I&amp;#8217;m widely satisfied what we&amp;#8217;ve reached: Being probably the most important free software conference in Mexico.
Not too much people attended this year, but I&amp;#8217;m happy I could shake hands with lots of them. I want to thank specially Steve Langasek, who only could be here three days; Gustavo Noronha, what could I say about him? kov rocks ;-) and Fernanda Weiden who gave CONSOL a nice and interesting &amp;#8220;Free software with a female touch&amp;#8221; talk.</description>

Como no tengo cámara para tomarme fotos detalladas, sólo puedo mostrar una que me tomó el buen Daniel Blanco, de Nekotec, desde su teléfono Sonny Ericsson, quizá no sea la mejor fotografía, pero algo es algo:</description>

      <description>Something was funny yesterday.
GLIB (Grupo de Usuarios de Linux del Bajío). Yesterday they had a meeting in Celaya, which is my born town. They invited me, and because of the place of the meeting I immediately accepted it: It would be fantastic to go to a Linux talk in the town where I were born and grew up.
After the talk, I realized how things can change. When I left Celaya to come to Mexico City I was 11 years old.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve also started to work on a Debian package, which was in the past RFP&amp;#8217;ed, and I&amp;#8217;ve added some interesting stuff in to the package:  For example, I&amp;#8217;m using mambo right now at my website/weblog.

Acá en la Ciudad de México hay una gran cantidad de Starbucks. Intentando recordar rápidamente, me vienen a la mente tres establecimientos. Hay uno frente al World Trade Center México, otro por Insurgentes, a la altura de Plaza Inn. Y quizás el que tengo más presente, en Santa Fé, frente a la universidad, en la zona restaurantera del área.</description>

      <description>OK, tengo que aceptar que este post es una reverenda mamada, pero bueno, es divertido para la banda chilanga, por favor no se sientan ofendidos los norteños :-)
El día de antier compré varios discos, entre ellos uno que me robaron hace como un año (valía la pena volver a comprarlo): Super Riddim International Vol. 1, de El Gran Silencio.
Total, luego de escuchar la primera rola me transporté al norte del país, a cualquier ciudad en el norte e inmediatamente pensé que era como escuchar a Ion.</description>

      <description>Una enorme disculpa al Grupo Linux del Bajío por mi ausencia el sábado pasado donde celebraron su 4to aniversario. La verdad me siento muy apenado.
Resulta que nunca recordé que el evento era para el sábado 18, todo el tiempo pensé que era para el 28. De hecho ese mismo sábado, debido a que choqué dos días antes, había mandado mi coche al taller y estaba por darle servicio (para sacarlo a carretera hasta Irapuato).</description>

      <description>Estos días son bastante relajados. Contaré todo lo que ha pasado.
El miércoles por la mañana le llamé a Tato para ver si podía acompañarme a comprar llantas, con su membresía al Costco. Quizá haya sido mucho mejor ir a buscarlas a la Buenos Aires, o a Santa Martha, pero bueno prefiero comprarlas en un lugar más establecido, aunque me haya salido más caro :-P
Total fui por él, y luego de que me invitó a comer una deliciosas tortas de cochinita pibil :-) nos lanzamos al Costco.</description>

      <description>A continuación transcribo una serie muy interesante de consejos para las compras en esta Navidad que he recibido de Greenpeace, a ver qué tal les parece. Compra productos duraderos, evita los que son desechables. Evita los productos con empaques excesivos y procura envolver tus regalos de la forma más sencilla evitando papeles, moños y etiquetas. Compra usado (libros, discos, video juegos, etc.) Realiza tu cena con alimentos orgánicos. Evita comprar árboles de navidad, en su lugar mejor decora árboles vivos.</description>

      <description>El día de hoy estuve haciendo un paquetito para Debian con un script sencillísimo que cambia aleatoriamente el background de GNOME, usando gconftool-2.
El paquete está dividido en dos: el script (y 6 wallpapers base) y un paquete con extras, que contiene 300 wallpapers, de mi propia colección personal ;-)
El paquete no podrá entrar oficialmente a Debian como está ahora, debido a que la mayoría de los wallpapers son obtenidos de deviantart, que le atribuye una serie de restricciones legales a las imágenes que ahí se publican.</description>

      <description>La activista keniana Wangari Maathai ha sido galardonada con el Premio Nobel de la Paz.
Es la primera vez que una mujer africana recibo dicho galardón, cosa que es enormemente loable para la lucha contra la segregación racial y de género.
El Premio Nobel de la Paz 2004 indicó que recibía dicho premio (acompañado de cerca de 1.4 millones de dólares) a nombre de los hombres, mujeres y niños africanos que luchan por un mejor medio ambiente.</description>

Sin lugar a dudas, la materia más interesante que tomaré será Programación Aplicada y Laboratorio, que curiosamente la imparte Andrés Tortolero, quien trabaja conmigo en Nekotec ;-) Espero que no tenga tantos problemas, la clase se basa en programación en C y GTK, con quienes he jugado un par de veces en el pasado.</description>

      <description>Pues el día de hoy he recibido sendas agradables noticias.
En primer lugar, he sido aprobado en la etapa Tasks and Skills, del proceso de Nuevo Mantenedor, lo cual significa que estoy cerca de convertirme en desarrollador oficial de Debian.
Más específicamente significa que ya no depende tanto de mí, si no simplemente esperar un par de etapas, que ya no dependen del todo de mí. Todo lo que hubiera podido haber dicho, o hecho, ya está en el pasado.</description>

Un partido de suma tensión, pero los Pumas han podido sacar la mínima ventaja, ganando 4-3.
Ojalá el domingo puedan mantener la ventaja en el marcador global: Habrá que ver.
En otras cosas, el próximo sábado, iré, junto con tigrux, hacia Ixmiquilpan, a dictar una plática sobre Debian ;-)

      <description>Pues jugando un poco con GConf, me he hecho un mini scriptcito en Perl para cambiar los wallpapers cada 60 segundos, en GNOME. Esta idea me surgió debido a que alguna vez vi que el Ta^3 tiene esta conducta en su XFCE4. Quizás haya una forma más limpia de hacer ésto, pero bueno, al menos funciona, incluso lanzando el script como una aplicación al iniciar GNOME. Lo único que necesitamos es, obviamente GConf.</description>

Sin embargo, debido a que dicho planet únicamente se encuentra con sindicados parlando inglés, he decidido abrir un nuevo blog que sólo se centrará en cosas debianosas que vaya haciendo. Ese nuevo blog lo puse en damog_deb, por si a alguien le resulta de alguna forma interesante.</description>

Realmente no sé por qué la gente que tiene blogs y cuya vida está muy relacionada al software libre no usa LiveJournal.
¿Por qué utilizarlo? Por que desde su página principal me siento en casa: LiveJournal is a simple-to-use (but extremely powerful and customizable) personal publishing (&amp;#8220;blogging&amp;#8221;) tool, built on open source software.</description>

Llegó el miércoles y el día de hoy regresaba a NYC, sin embargo el tiempo de espera en su conexión era de siete horas, por ello nos pusimos de acuerdo y pasé por él al aeropuerto para ir a desayunar y para darle una pequeña visita turística.
Fuimos por la mañana a desayunar al café Bullé en el Centro Histórico, que personalmente me agrada mucho, en la calle de Madero, bastante cerca al Zócalo.</description>

En primer lugar he quitado jaws. Es un excelente proyecto el que llevan, sin embargo no comparto muchas de sus opiniones. Me podrán llamar ardido, pero simplemente es una mamada éste thread y éste mail. Además de que quizás tienen un enfoque un tanto diferente a lo que me puede llegar a llamar la atención.
Además de haber quitado jaws, dejaré de escribir en inglés ;-) En primer lugar por que ni yo me entendía :-P, y en segundo lugar, por que definitivamente escribo mucho más rápido en español, eso es a todas luces notorio.</description>

Muchas buenas y bonitas mejoras, bug fixes por todas partes, añadieron la administración para el gadget del blog (del cual había hecho una interfacecita para uso personal), el chatbox, y varias cosas más, de las cuales resalta el filebrowser.
Caray, y qué decir del diseño. Está bastante agradable, elegante, sencillo, limpio, da la impresión de estabilidad, de fortaleza y candidez ;)</description>

      <description>Well, Jordi and I started hacking today on Planet. He gave me some moral support while coding on Python, language that I really do not know perfectly.
He worked on the JAWS code, to see why they reported as 00 hours on their RSS feeds.
So, here is the important thing: If you are using JAWS, and are syndicated on PlanetaLinux, you probably should see that sometimes your feed is not well synchronized, that is because of that bug.</description>

Formateo de fechas de acuerdo a GMT. Se aÃ±ada un parseador para los tags de HTML de JAWS que no se interpretan, por ejemplo las comillas.</description>

I’ve worked on the art/configuration, we still have some problems because the five people now suscribed to the planet use jaws which have a little encoding problem.
Feedback is very welcome.</description>

      <description>So, as I already wrote before, Dalai Lama was in Mexico for the last week, and on thrusday he was at college receiving an Honoris Causa Doctorate by the UIA-ITESO educational system. Funny guy.
I wasn’t able to get into the main auditorium. A complete security system was installed in the university. Metal scanners were a PITA. Invitation was required, a la Orkut. Anyway, we could watch the event by video conference broadcasted by the university over the Internet.</description>

      <description>Today I have been atacked by a flu. I hate the sore throat, the body pain, headache, etc.
Anyway, today it was my sister’s birthday. She is 25 now, and to bother her I tell her, she is a quater of century years old, sounds older I gave her a nice tiny blue sweater as present. Anyway, sweaters are cheaper on summer I hope this weekend the dcontrol team will be launching a survey for Debian users.</description>

      <description>Well, I took this video game character quiz. Here is the result:  I am a Defender-ship. I am fiercely protective of my friends and loved ones, and unforgiving of any who would hurt them. Speed and foresight are my strengths, at the cost of a little clumsiness. I’m most comfortable with a few friends, but sometimes particularly enjoy spending time in larger groups. What Video Game Character Are You?</description>

      <description>Today, I bought a couple of .mx domains, since they are on some kind of special offer, quite cheap.
The interesting domain I bought was debian.com.mx which will point, at least now, to Debian MÃ©xico project. I’m hoping to get debian.net.mx once, but NIC MX is in general a bad service.
I’ll somewhat busy in the next few days, mainly because of an AutoCAD project that I have to deliver tomorrow, and a physics exam some day, don’t know yet the exact date.</description>

      <description>I recently noticed that Cartoon Network, one of my beloved TV channels, will (or is already) launch a new cartoon concept. At least, new for them.
Adult Swim is a block where they are broadcasting some cartoon for adults. They argue about the age of their audience, saying that more grown and mature people watch CN. That’s way, in a night block (from 11&amp;#160;pm to 5 am) they are showing cartoon series such as Family Guy and Futurama, both Fox superhits, and some others like The Ripping Friends, a very nice show of ‘bad boys’ that I had the chance to watch once and Lupin The 3rd, which is the story of a thief.</description>

Festival de Software Libre was pretty cool, although, I couldn’t find a real [and usable] access point for my connection needs Some great things happened.  Day 1, tuesday. Tacvbo and I arrived Guadalajara around 7:15&amp;#160;pm and wait for someone to pick us up for more than one hour. Finally, a very funny guy, Bernardo, picked us up. We went to the hotel, and then to have dinner with him, and two other guys.</description>

      <description>I have received several comments on why am I writing my blog in English, since many of the Mexican guys involved on free software who own a blog and use to blog periodicly, don’t. Obviously I had to talk about this some time because it is not usual.   i18n. Do you really do not understand English? Or probably my English? If you do, who cares?  Reach. It is widely know English reaches more people than only a few people.</description>

      <description>Isn’t it annoying to syndicate a feed, any kind (RSS, RDF, OPML, Atom) and the new is only a few lines long? It is not the entire blog entry, only a few words. I hate that, it makes you decide between:  Get the RSS reader to the Trash bin and visit the website. Piss off the coder of the feed.   If I’m using a reader, I obviously will prefer the second option.</description>

I’m giving a talk at Festival de Software Libre in Gualadajara, on thrusday. It will be about colaboration in free software projects, focused on Debian.
The other important thing to do is a physics exam on Friday, so it will be madness to cover both things, and try to not lose more classes than the ones I will, so this is my plan:  Monday 27 th.</description>

      <description>The Dalai Lama, one of the most important moral and spiritual leaders in the world, Peace Nobel Price in 1989, will be in Mexico next 3-8 October.


He will be here mainly because, the University will give him an Honoris Causa doctorate. That&amp;#8217;s greatly unbelievable, to have it here, in the college, next October 7th, I bet this will be madness, I hope I could get into the main auditorium that day.</description>

      <description>So, lately I&amp;#8217;ve been over IRC spending lots of time.I started using xchat-gnome but it really seems to young, it doesn&amp;#8217;t implement much features and crashes lots of times.


So, I continued using normal X-Chat, and the madness is all the channels I&amp;#8217;m logged in anytime.


So, Martin Michlmayr, the current Debian Project Leader, sent an email for debian-project mailing list inviting to donate to FFII: FFII supports the development of public information goods based on copyright, free competition, and open standards.</description>

      <description>Today, actually yesterday (September 16th), was Mexican Independence Day. A day like today, almost 200 years ago, 1810, Mexicans began their way to freedom. This year also, it is the 150th birthday of the Mexican Anthem, composed by Bocanegra and Nunó.
Obviously, that day is, nowadays, an excuse for drinking and celebrating. I really didn&amp;#8217;t do anything on the eve. I stayed at home working on several things. I remembered, one year ago, ion came to Mexico City, from Chihuahua, and I took him to a party I was invited, stupidly far away from here, near to the exit to Cuernavaca, a city 80&amp;#160;km to the south of the city.</description>

      <description>Well, it is almost 5 am, but I did it ;-) Evolution 2.0 running over Debian.
You probably may not heard about Evo2. Evolution 2, AFAIK, was intended to be released with GNOME 2.8 (out today), but didn&amp;#8217;t make it. It is not officially released, but it exists as stable in GNOME ftp&amp;#8217;s. I&amp;#8217;m going to do a couple of packages for running normally Evolution 2 over SID, libgtkhtml, evolution-data-server and so.</description>

School It is refreshing sometime when you have plenty of things to do. A couple of projects, homework, studying, but specially when you really like your career. Obviously this is my case now, although tons of things to do for the next week.
Work Apparently next week will also be a very tired one: Giving some courses of Moodle to some teachers become a heavy and dying work.</description>

 mathomatic which is a wonderful computer algebra system. The fact that I have always to do this by hand. The taste of pork :-)  That&amp;rsquo;s how I bring to life: gChicharronero.
gChicharronero is a little GNOME application to calculate the values of x in a square equation.
I&amp;rsquo;m not releasing this because it is still too young and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Ruby is an object-oriented programming language developed for the purpose of making programming both enjoyable and fast. With its easy-to-use interpreter, easy-to-understand syntax, complete object-oriented functionality, and powerful class libraries, Ruby has become a language that can be used in a broad range of fields: from text processing and CGI scripts to professional, large-scale programs.
&amp;#8220;As a programmer and a programming-language geek, I know what makes me happy while programming, and I designed Ruby with these elements in mind.</description>

It runs embedded on a browser, running some kind of Java applets, which is sad.</description>

LiveJournal is a free software company, using free software to build a business. That&amp;#8217;s widely cool, they are not the same kind of company that allows you to store a webservice and then gets yourself deep on spam. That&amp;#8217;s ethic.
But, why am I using LiveJournal web service instead of jaws, *Nuke or other web logs?</description>

      <description>Well, my birthday is coming soon (August 8th) :)
So, if you feel like wanting to give me some kind of gift, here is my Amazon&amp;#8217;s wishlist :-)

      <description>Well, I just bought a Preferred Membership of Live365 a few days ago, and I really like it.
If you are a close person with me, you&amp;#8217;ll know I have no regular music on my PC (aka, mp3). So I began, a few months ago, to listen to Live365 stations, which are really cool. Lots of music, lots of genres, etc.
The stations on my profile:   Alternative Nation Radio.</description>

      <description>Finally today was our Debian Control Center meeting. I was pretty cool, I was happy to see the channel full of people, although not every one was in the active talk.
The log can be reached here.
Seems like we have to start really working.
Tomorrow I&amp;#8217;m giving a course with Ta^3 and p4ola of Linux, it is a long course of 80 hours, I&amp;#8217;m giving the three first days (24 hours) on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, after that I hope I could go to some vacation days next weekend, hopefully to Acapulco, but if I am lucky (which means money), I would love to go to Cuba, but I see it a little bit difficult, probably Cancun would be a better and cheaper choice.</description>

      <description>I was very happy to see my name on the Debian Weekly News yesterday announcing the IRC meeting for the Debian Control Center (or Centre, ;-).
It seems that lots of people is getting interest on this issue. I&amp;#8217;m working on the talk schedule for Sunday, I&amp;#8217;ll publish it soon, I hope today.

      <description>Finally, libgtk-trayicon-ruby (and -ruby1.8) has entered to Debian queue. This was done thanks to Paul van Tilburg.
The reason I filled an ITP for trayicon library of Ruby was a couple of things:  I wanted to learn Ruby stuff, which seems pretty cool. Like a nice combination of Perl and Python. The best of both are on Ruby. I was planning to package GNOME GTray.   The first reason was pretty cool.</description>

      <description>Well, I put my ass on a bus, and eight hours later I was in Coatzacoalcos, in the beautiful state of Veracruz, very near to Tabasco.
I came for a couple of days to do some work with Salvador, which is in charge of the Linux User Group of Coatza and besides, he is the founder of the never-born NetBSD-MX project.
Hot? Well, It is 8:21 in the morning, I&amp;#8217;m sitting on a bed with wireless access, with a huge fan next to me, can&amp;#8217;t complain.</description>

      <description>Well, yeah. Lots of things has happened on the last days. Let&amp;#8217;s start without particular order.
* My mother went ill because of pressure and stress. She, fortunately, is getting better. I have to start doing some things by myself, which she used to do.
* My DSL modem was fucked up by a ray storm. The thing is, the only thing that was fucked up was the ethernet port&amp;#8230; It&amp;#8217;s insane, because the USB port is still running.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been playing a little bit with some stupid nicknames on the MSN&amp;#8230;
What could happen if I were a damogof hot chocolate, or white chocolate, or cookies and cream chocolate? Maybe a strawberry jam damog. Probably I would prefer to be a sweet rice and milk candy damog, or a marshmallow one. ;) Who know? What would you like to be?</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was at Ismael Olea&amp;#8217;s course, organized by UPN, talking about technical documentation, and editing stuff. It was quite interesting how he can point to some specific needed issues. This issues are commonly mistakes of the writers, the coders, the speakers, everybody involved on linguistics.
We had the first class yesterday, it will happen in several days, four hours each. And yes, his Spanish is somewhat difficult to understand, he is an Andaluz, I can&amp;#8217;t really understand the difference between all that Spanish provinces, but for example, I remember I _could_ understand and talk very nice with Amaya and Jesús, even with Álvaro, but Ismael is so different.</description>

I like the Buddhism stuff: Its philosophy, its culture, its music, its feeling, its thought. Listen to it.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m feeling kinda sad. Because many things in Mexico suck.
Getting back from Brazil, made me realize that Mexico needs too much for being a better country, starting from the citizens: The common society.
I&amp;#8217;m feeling lazy, frustrated, sad: My stomach is getting worst than ever. And work is so boring.

And finally, tomorrow, I&amp;#8217;m getting back home. Home, sweet home.

      <description>Well, yesterday a nice crew were on Tacvbo&amp;#8217;s, 13 guys drinking beer and sharing some nice moments (as I remember the room on a clock-like turn): p4ola, zerver, royald, tuxfer, Odín, Little_Bear, MiG, Tato, Ramón Carazo, GnuOwned, Juan (AntiloOp&amp;#8217;s cousin) and AntiloOp.
It was nice to meet some guys I have seen on pictures before, or talked on IRC like GnuOwned and AntiloOp.
Anyway I woke up this morning and I was so thirsty, my tongue was dry and my mouth in need of a beer, but I just drank some lemon water which my mom made yesterday: It is so cool that water when you need it, it is refreshing, like seeing a dolphin swim when you are in a boat (I always have associated the fact of a dolphin swimming in the ocean, with refreshing freedom ;)</description>

So, my little problem of today is:
How can a user validate a file size _before_ uploading it over an HTML/HTTP form?
I can think on JavaScript, but there is a little problem that makes my head twisted: I do not know anything about JS.
Anyway, making some nice research on the WWW about some scripts on this, I haven&amp;#8217;t found anything useful XD.</description>

And my time on the computer will be reduced, damn.
Anyway, I have to find some time to package jaws, which I have a ITP for almost two months and a half. I will probably use Drupal package to get based, as it is a nice and very similar example.</description>

One thing that made me laugh is Gunnar carrying his Sparc Classic and probably an Indy workstation: I would really prefer to have some clothes, instead of carrying a damn heavy computer :-P We&amp;#8217;ll be there around 15 days (for DebConf4 and 5FISL), and at least I&amp;#8217;ll need a couple of things: Enough clothes and money :-P</description>

The only true is that I am happy :-).

Anyway, I remember the time when I used to draw more: I was around 12 or 13, drawing Street Fighter characters ^_^ (I&amp;#8217;ve been playing SF with Toño, my pal, with mame at work, it&amp;#8217;s nice).
So, I think LiveJournal is nice: the LogJam client is easy, and you can reach some interesting features: Mood and logjam-xmms.</description>

      <description>Well, I am back again with a blog. I hope this time will be better, or maybe I won&amp;#8217;t drop it soon :-P
Why blogging again? Because I&amp;#8217;m on vacation (just school), and I can have a little bit more time to think on shitty things like this ;D</description>

      <description>Jjajaja… No encontraba un papel, ni nada para apuntar la tarea, así que la apunto aquí ;-) 1. ¿Qué es polimorfismo?
 ¿Qué es herencia?
 ¿Qué es encapsulamiento?
  I. Hacer un programa en Java (se pronuncia &amp;lsquo;jaba&amp;rsquo;, no &amp;lsquo;yaba&amp;rsquo;) que proporcione un valor e indique si el valor es positivo, negativo o cero. II. Resolver la ecuación general, proporcionando los valores para a, b y c respectivamente utilizando la sentencia if, verificar si los resultados para x1 y x2 son números imaginarios o tienen valores.</description>

      <description>Pues cada vez se acerca más CONSOL y ello se puede notar en la lista de correo, en las juntas y en la presión que nos aprieta.
Este año tendremos varias cosas muy buenas. En primer lugar, será en el IPN, en las instalaciones del ESIME Zacatenco. Nos acompañarán Larry Wall, Dave Poirier, Bdale Garbee, el buen Ismael Olea, Álvaro Herrera (un chileno desarrollador de PostgreSQL) y el buen Alan Aspuru.</description>

      <description>Pues bueno, luego de casi dos meses de prometer un visit counter (que se diferencía de un hit counter debido a que el hit counter suma cada recarga del sitio y el visit counter lo hace con cada IP), está listo. Para instalarlo, hay que instalar antes el hit_counter (para la creación de las tablas en la base de datos, etc.). Las explicaciones para instalar el hit_counter están acá. Una vez instalado el hit_counter, hay que reemplazar el hit_counter.</description>

También en este semestre que se celebra, estaré trabajando ahí mismo en la Universidad, será divertido (más bien, lo está siendo).
Y bueno, lo de siempre, seguir con la diversión del software libre ;-) Con un par de planes más que tengo pensados.</description>

      <description>Pues bueno, inspirado un poco en algunos sitios con sistemas completos web orientados a la localización de ports de BSD, me he decidido a empezar un pequeño sistema web para hacer precisamente eso.
Ahora mismo tengo mil y un cosas que hacer, en la escuela, el trabajo y otros proyectos, pero voy a darle en mis ratos libres a este sistema que estará escrito en PHP, y el cual estará inspirado en algunos otros populares sistemas como openbsdports.</description>

Apenas el día de ayer me decía mi buen amigo Dolphmef que había sido víctima de un asalto exprés (lo calificó como un secuestro exprés, aunque yo no lo considero de esa manera).
Él y otro amigo en común, Tomás, regresaban a media tarde de no-sé-dónde. Tomás había ido a dejarlo en su coche hasta su casa -ubicada en Uxmal, en la Col. Narvarte, a escasas 3-4 cuadras de la mía-.</description>

Tengo que aclarar que no soy ningún gurú sobre esto. Todo lo que escribo son las experiencias de un novato instalando su primer sistema *BSD.
Aclarado lo anterior, procedamos.</description>

Asistí principalmente por la presencia de Quino, creador de Mafalda, y también para saludar a Sandra y Claudia, de las cuales sólo pude ver a la primera, debido a que el celular de Claudia nunca estuvo activo.
En fin, llegué a eso de las 7:20 de la mañana sin tener rumbo.</description>

Yo lo tengo nombrado como un archivo PHP, debido a que mando llamar un script desde el CSS, solamente se tiene que reemplazar la palabra &amp;#8216;randomimage.php&amp;#8217; de la línea 23, por el nombre de la imagen de la cabecera. Otra cosa, un truquito&amp;#8230; Como bien conoce todo usuario del weblog, JAWS manda al histórico todos los mensajes de un mes que acaba de terminar, cuando encuentra un mensaje nuevo fechado por un mes nuevo.</description>

En casa, el árbol, las luces, los adornos, delatan el espíritu navideño. No quiero entrar en discusión sobre las deficiencias de la fiestas de diciembre, sólamente quiero compartir, en este pequeño espacio, mi Wish List de Amazon :D
Si alguien me quiere regalar algo de Navidad, puede ver mi lista de deseos :D Mucha de esos artículos son regalos pequeños que había tenido pensando obsequiar, como los aretes o la femenina bufanda :P</description>

      <description>Pues son las siete y media de la mañana, lunes.
Entro a leer la columna semanal de Javier Matuk y leo su texto acerca de la compra de SuSE y Ximian por parte de IBM al emporio rojo. No me gusta la forma que aborda Matuk, en forma de chisme, del asunto, podría denotar un modo de informalidad por parte del desarrollo de Linux y de su ya consolidado soporte a usuarios por parte de empresas en todo el orbe.</description>

      <description>Parece que a partir de la liberación de JAWS, muchos integrantes de la comunidad de software libre se ha decidido por montar su blog.
Es increíble ver como los blogrolls llevan a decenas de sitios personales, donde uno puede aprender muchísimo de otras personas. Y me he dado cuenta de ese redescubrimiento del blog por la cantidad de sitios que visito a diario:
Al iniciar el recorrido por los sitios, checo los blogs que siempre he checado, el de Cofradía, el de Slashdot (antes visitaba otros como Linux Para Todos, UnixMexico, Barrapunto, entre otros, pero ya casi no), y de entre los personales, el de ion, el de Jordi, entre otros.</description>

El día de ayer se realizó el InstallFest del GULIbero. Estuvo bien, pronto pondré las fotos que el pitakill tomó.
La próxima semana son mis dos últimas semanas de clase: Van a estar de locos. Espero adelantar mucho por el momento.</description>

      <description>Pues el día de hoy, mientras revisaba un par de scriptcillos de la escuela, abrí una Eterm, y el fortune que me mandó fue una excelente y hermosa frase: Linux: Because a PC is a terrible thing to waste. (By komarimf@craft.camp.clarkson.edu, Mark Komarinski)  ¿No es una hermosa frase? :D </description>

      <description>El día de hoy he estado trabajando en un nuevo gadget para JAWS: Un gadget para mostrar las páginas, ligas, sitios que a uno más le gustan junto con una pequeña descripción hecha por el usuario. Aún no lo pongo disponible :P debido a que aún hay algunas cosas que refinar, espero que mañana lunes o el martes, esté listo el gadget. Mientras, puede verse cómo se mostraría en la sección de Links.</description>

      <description>He quitado mi galería. La tenía alojada en mi servidor casero, pero el ancho de banda simplemente no aguanta, pronto lo volveré a subir pronto: Es muy incómodo estar trabajando en Internet en casa y que de repente se alente a madres, por que un pringao ve mis fotos :P
Las pondré en otro lado.
Mientras tanto me encuentro echando la mano un poco más con Linux México. Se necesita un poco más de contenido y de cosas menores, quizá ir mejorando cada vez el pequeño sistemita.</description>

      <description>Pues continuando de colaborar con JAWS un poquito, me hice éste gadget que cuenta los hits que se hacen del sitio.
Hay que crear una tabla dentro de la base de datos de JAWS, es muy sencillo: Nos ubicamos en el prompt de MySQL y empezamos: mysql&amp;gt; USE base_de_datos_de_jaws;
mysql&amp;gt; CREATE TABLE counter (visits int(9));
mysql&amp;gt; INSERT INTO counter VALUES (0);
mysql&amp;gt; INSERT INTO registry VALUES (36,&amp;lsquo;/gadgets/hit_counter/enabled&amp;rsquo;,&amp;lsquo;true&amp;rsquo;);  Algunas observaciones: Obviamente puede usarse cualquier otro tipo de parámetro para la columna &amp;#8216;visits&amp;#8217; de la tabla &amp;#8216;counter&amp;#8217;.</description>

      <description>Pues el día de hoy me compré una bonita y linda camarita digital&amp;#8230; Ya tenía muchas ganas de una. Al menos, para tomar fotos aquí, allá y acullá.  Por lo pronto ha estado trabajando estupendamente con Debian GNU/Linux y con eso ya puedo estar contento :) Hoy estuve en la casa del MiG y luego en casa del Ta^3, muy agradable toda la tarde/noche, junto, también, del Wada. ;) </description>

      <description>Pues he terminado un pequeño gadgetcito para JAWS para hacer búsquedas en Google. Espero adaptarle un pequeño admin, pero por lo pronto es usable. Para instalarlo, hay que hacer lo siguiente (ahora que lo pienso, estaría bien que JAWS tuviera una interfacecita para adhesión de gadgets nuevos, a ver qué se puede hacer).  Bajar éste archivo PHP. % wget http://www.damog.net/files/google.phps Hay que renombrarlo a google.php, el google.phpS es para que se muestre el contenido.</description>

      <description>Jajaja&amp;#8230; Pues el día de hoy estaba trabajando en mi clase de Cálculo I con el software Mathematica. Es una maravilla resolviendo derivadas simples y parciales, integrales definidas e indefinidas, y un enorme etcétera. Pero con una simple exponenciación no puede:  :-) Caray&amp;#8230; Ya ni las ganas de pagar la licencia de estudiante, que cuesta 150 USD, ni la Enterprise, que cuesta 3&amp;#8217;850 USD. :P </description>

Espero que la respuesta de la comunidad universitaria de la UIA sea satisfactoria.
 Lanzamos nuestro primer evento, que se tiene pensado para mediados de noviembre, un Install Fest. Por lo pronto, el grupo ha recibido mejor acogida por parte de la gente de Ingeniería Electrónica y de Comunicaciones, que por los de Sistemas Computarizados. En fin, no es nueva esa situación.
Seguramente la URL cambiará, pero por el momento, el lugar donde se encuentra el sitio del GULIbero es http://pollux.</description>

Compiling your source code files can be tedious, specially when you want to include several source files and have to type the compiling command everytime you want to do it.
 Well, I have news for you&amp;#8230; Your days of command line compiling are (mostly) over, because YOU will learn how to write Makefiles.
 Así sí me animo a aprender Makefiles :-D Siempre se encuentran estos tipos de sitios, que amenamente te invitan a aprender :D</description>

Lo que puedo decir hasta el momento son varios puntos:  Es una distribución muy completa. Fácil instalación si, y sólo si, se tiene un disco duro en blanco.</description>

      <description>Pues resulta que Lurkan y Toño Galicia, han convocado a una reunión de usuarios. Quieren hacer lo que se hacía en la UNAM en Nucleares, reuniones cada mes y todo eso.
Personalmente lo veo difícil, el IPN está muy alejado de la zona que por costumbre, se hizo como un punto de encuentro a usuarios y desarrolladores: La zona centro/sur del DF. El norte de la ciudad a veces es conflictivo, desde mi punto de vista.</description>

      <description>Y no precisamente por el sistema operativo de Sun® basado en Unix®. :P
Acabo de ver el filme Solaris, protagonizado por George Clonney y dirigido por Steven Soderbergh. Es una película que trata sobre el viaje de una tripulación a una bola y/o masa de energía llamada Solaris; lo interesante es que los recuerdos de sus seres queridos, se hacen concientes.
Una película que rivaliza enormemente con momentos de gran lucidez y debraye.</description>

      <description>Pues bueno&amp;#8230; Van dos semanas desde que estuve en el GUL3V que fue cuando me decidí a cambiar de MySQL a PostgreSQL y aún ni mis luces.
Hoy estuve leyendo mucha documentación de MySQL que no había leído y me di cuenta que la diferencia entre ambas bases de datos es únicamente el enfoque que deba tener el sistema donde esté siendo empleada. No seré, desde luego, un fanático de alguna de las dos bases de datos, como suele pasar entre los diferentes sabrores de distribuciones de Linux, o de lenguajes de programación.</description>

- Negro, ¿y si vamos a Cuernavaca? - exclamé rompiendo el silencio que sólo de vez en vez se quebrantaba por el tipeo de las teclas. - Pu&amp;#8217;s si quieres.
Y partimos con rumbo a la carretera. Una carretera muy oscura. La última vez que había ido en ella, había sido en la fiesta de un amigo, que como es costumbre, estaba de la verga.</description>

Volví de la escuela, a comer, y luego a trabajar. Estuve administrando y revisando el nuevo y reluciente servidor dedicado :)
Por la noche me fui a casa del Pecas, con Polo, por allá bebimos con algunos amigos, entre ellos, el buen Saltiel.</description>

¡Ah, qué rica es! Aunque ahora meditándolo un poco, quizás no lo sea. No sé, a veces sabe bien, otras veces no.
El pasado jueves estuve en una reunión de Cofradía en la hamburguería Faffa&amp;#8217;s. Había comido únicamente una sopa Maruchan, tenía unas incontenibles (que resultaron sí contenibles) ganas de defecar que me hacía temblar y sudar seco.</description>

      <description>Alguien se ha puesto a escribir un texto similar al que en estos momentos escribo en algún lugar inusual, o simplemente en algún lugar diferente al que siempre se usa? Generalmente yo escribo cualquier cosa, trabajo, me hago güey desde mi computadora posicionada dentro de mi habitación, en un escueto escritorio. Ahora que menciono la palabra &amp;#8216;escueto&amp;#8217; me doy cuenta de que realmente es una palabra que se ha popularizado de tal forma que ha dejado de ser divertido usarla.</description>

      <description>Pues, para no perder la costumbre, he estado escuchando una estación de radio por Internet, muy buena, de ska.
Ska Jerk es en sí un sitio más de información relacionada al ska, reggae, rock steady, mento y demás música de buena vibra. Un sitio con información, enlaces, galería fotográfica, historia, etc.
Lo que hace a Ska Jerk un fenomenal sitio de reunión es precisamente la estación que tienen al aire. Están conectados a través de los servidores de Live 365, lo cual los dota de un excelente ancho de banda y se permiten tener a cientos de usuarios conectados escuchando la estación.</description>

      <description>Recuerdo la última vez que estuve de vacaciones. Fue en abril de 2002. Mis pubertos e imbéciles compañeros de la preparatoria creían que estar en Cancún, persiguiendo y correteando a extranjeras alcohólicas era su fin último en la vida. Nada más alejado de la realidad. Generalmente no pasa nada más allá de eso. Quizá entren a la universidad, quizá ya entraron. Y su cerebro quizá siga del mismo tamaño en que lo desarrollaron hasta el segundo grado de la primaria, cuando eran alumnos y pupilos destacados.</description>

      <description>Pues bueno, luego de no quedar muy a gusto con B2/Cafelog, me aventuro a usar este software que me recomendó mi buen carnal, Ehecatl, llamado Nucleus.
A ver qué tal jala.
Aún no lo conozco muy bien, pero iré aprendiendo poco a poco. Paso Número Uno: Traducir todas las leyendas que aparecen aquí, settear los links e instalar un photolog, para cuando compre mi cámara digital. ;)</description>

      <description>Una y otra vez me doy cuenta de que las palabras vienen a mí, por que sí. No tienen realmente un significado, simplemente escribo lo que me viene a la mente, lo que me viene a los dedos cuando estoy junto a la computadora.
La laptop me incita, me invita, me conmina a escribir. Es algo muy padre, es algo que realmente me agrada. Recomiendo a cualquier persona, que pueda, conseguir una computadora portátil.</description>

El día de hoy acudí a ejercer mi derecho al voto en las urnas. Con tres elecciones juntas, jefe delegacional, diputados federales y para Asamble Legislativa, la pequeña casilla, ubicada a dos cuadras de mi casa, estaba atascada de gente.
Cabe mencionar que es la primera vez que participo en elecciones. Primero llegué a formarme, junto con mi hermana y padres.</description>

      <description>Ya tenía un ratito que no escribía en ésta mi casa. Damog.org. Ah, qué bonito se oye al pronunciar místicamente el PUNTO ORG. Es como una sensación extrasensorial que envuelve mi lengua, mi boca, hace vibrar mis dientes y finalmente se produce el sonido. Espectacular, magnífico.
El otro día filosofaba sobre el cambiar Damog.org a Damog.net. No sé que repercusiones metafísicas/ideológicas se produzcan, quizá un día amanezca y en vez de Damog.</description>

Les presento mi primer programita:

public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(&amp;ldquo;Hola Damog.org!&amp;rdquo;);

      <description>Es increíble ver cómo puede cambiar la ciudad de México tan sólo por circular en ella. La gente camina en sus rumbos conociendo a la gente, conociendo las casas, conociendo todo lo que por ahí pasa. Sin embargo poca gente se da verdadera cuenta de cómo puede una misma ciudad tan radicalmente debido a la segregación y pobreza.
Esa situación me da pena. Me considero muchas veces una persona del pueblo, y que no tiene gran cosa.</description>

      <description>Qué desmadre, qué desmadre, qué desmadre. CONSOL ha sido algo así como un desmadre que no podemos controlar a la perfección. CloE me desesperó, ni siquiera mi madre me ordena (bueno, a veces =P). Gunnar como que se desentendíó. Ta^3 al principio parecía ocupado, pero no hizo gran cosa al final. Yo hice trabajo en varios lados pero muy poco, es la verdad.
Solamente puedo concluir una sola cosa: Desmadre.</description>

      <description>Estoy en la UPN. Tomamos fotos previas, gracias a la cámara digital del The_Tre ;-) Además, vicm3 elaboró los thumbnails de las fotos con su programita =P
Se pueden ver las fotos desde aquí.</description>

      <description>El día de hoy me la viví en la UPN, tratando de hacer que jalara el sistema de registro del mig, bueno entre todos. Además vimos lo que se necesita. Mañana será un gran día, súper ocupado.
:-)
Por cierto, no habrá ponencia del GULDF en CONSOL. ¿Raro no?</description>

      <description>Bueno, por fin edité el index.html de este sitio. Fue creado con Bluefish. De hoy en adelante procuraré mantener este weblog al día, con cosas que me pasen o quiera contar al mundo. Bueno, para los dos visitantes que tengo al mes.
x-D
Como verás, las ligas están caídas. Haré las demás secciones prontamente. :-) Paciencia.</description>
