<p>A lot has been said about the elections already. I just want to share my personal experiences about it. During the weekend, Tom invited us to his place in lower Harlem (we live upper Harlem) on 123rd St and Adam Clayton Powell Jr Ave, for Tuesday night. As Tuesday arrived, we didn&rsquo;t see too many people too excited about it. Living in Harlem, we were pretty used to black people supporting Obama, so getting closer and closer to the elections, we didn&rsquo;t feel people anxious. On Tuesday, we commuted to work and some of our co-workers got to work late because they have been standing in lines for a couple of hours to vote in polls. The whole day was about talking on how much that day was representing for the US and the world, guessing how they results were going to end up, etc.</p>

<p>Later at night, Greg, Phil, Raquel and I headed to Tom&rsquo;s place for his watch-the-results party. His fridge was full of Blue Moon beer, but he also had some Red Stripe :) Since I like to go light on politics, I preferred some other American variantion, Coors Light :)</p>

<p>Vermont, Connecticut and a few other New England states were claimed by the Democrats. Matty, a friend of Tom attending the party brought US maps with the electoral votes on each one for people to color them as they were called. It was pretty fun. At some point we forgot about the maps since it was pretty clear that Obama was gonna win. But when they called him at around 11 pm (and I was starting to feel nicely drunk), the whole neighborhood and people in the streets just went completely nuts. It&rsquo;s something I hadn&rsquo;t experienced at all in my life, it was like if Mexico would have won the f√∫tbol World Cup (which yes, it will never happen anytime soon :P), but nicer. People went out to the Harlem State Office Building square were cars were honking, and a huge amount of people gathered to celebrate, play brass music, cheer &ldquo;Yes We Can&rdquo;. Ghetto guys, white hippies, curious latinos, Africans, African Americans, Puerto Ricans, just a lot, a lot of people, all kinds of them, just a clusterfuck. They projected Obama&rsquo;s speech from Chicago and people went nuts. It was just, fucking amazing. The images they projected from Harlem to the outside world was in that same square we were in.</p>
