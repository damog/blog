<p><strong>FÃºtbol</strong><br/><p>
Andoni (a very nice Basque friend), Nere (Panamenian), Nayeli, me and
others, went last wednesday to the Azteca stadium to see Mexico&#8217;s game
against Panama. Mexico had chance to qualify to the FIFA&#8217;s World Cup
since last saturday but they were completely humiliated at the Columbus
Crew stadium against the US. It&#8217;s a little bit sad to see how the US
have improved their soccer level through the years (last time Mexico
played in that specific stadium with the US, the latter lost 7-2, in
the 70s) and the rest of the teams in the area haven&#8217;t too much.<br/><br/>
Anyway, Mexico won 5-0 to Panama and we got our World Cup ticket for
Germany. US has also already qualified. One and a half more tickets are
available in the area, which I could bet it will be taken by Costa Rica
and the half ticket (will have to play against some team in Asia) will
be taken by Trinidad &amp; Tobago, or even Guatemala.<br/><br/>
Around 20-25&#8217;000 people were at the stadium which was a poor reply by
the fans. Specially in such a big stadium as Azteca is, the place
looked empty.<br/><br/></p>

Nayeli and Nere.<br/><br/><strong>Boxing</strong><br/><p>
I&#8217;ve been enjoying boxing lately. I don&#8217;t do any boxing, I mean
watching it :-) Last night I bought a PPV fight and invited some
friends to come to my place and watch it. It was really cool, with four
fights in total. We missed the first one since we went to the store to
buy some beer. In the second fight, some Hawaiian guy knocked out a
mexican one in the first round, heh. Erik &#8220;El Terrible&#8221; Morales was the
main fighter against an american guy (who was dressed like a king, with
a big crown with diamonds and a long cape) called Zahir Raheem. The
latter <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2158093" target="_blank">won the fight</a> with judges decission. El Terrible even fought a
couple of rounds with only one arm, making fun of his opponent who
ended winning him.<br/><br/>
Boxing is a great sport :-)<br/><br/><br/><br/></p></p>
