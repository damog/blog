<p>Today I have closed 729 work-needing and prospective packages bugs :-)<br/><br/>
156 of them were ITPs and the rest 573, RFPs. All of them were bugs
with a lifetime greater than 600 days old. Most of the ITPs closed were
inactive bugs for more than almost two years. The RFPs were not
consulted on this. Blame me if something went wrong with it.<br/><br/>
And please, do not complain about this: If people is still interested
on their packages, they are free, as usual, to reopen them. Let this
also work as a ping to inactive wnpp bugs.<br/><br/>
Please, think on the effort that several people (not only one or two
persons) are doing to clean the wnpp place a bit. Specially think on
the effort and hours spent there when sending ironic subjects on your
mails to control@b.d.o reopening your bugs.<br/><br/>
More work on this front will be done in the next days.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
