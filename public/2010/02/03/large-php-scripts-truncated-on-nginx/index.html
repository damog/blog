<p>I spent a couple of <em>hours</em> yesterday trying to debug an issue that made me hit my head against the wall while it lasted.</p>

<p>I run multiple instances of <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, and with it, comes a nice little editor bundled called <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a>. But on my main WordPress installation (<em>this</em> very blog, dear reader, where you are reading this from), TinyMCE wouldn&rsquo;t come up, it wouldn&rsquo;t render properly on the browser, it didn&rsquo;t matter if it was my main browser, Chrome, or Firefox, Safari, cached, uncached, it was just broken. Since I hadn&rsquo;t have the time to go through this issue before, I was using a different editor installed as a plugin. <em>LAME</em>. And coward.</p>

<p><img src="/old/stereonaut/2010/02/nginx.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Anyway, I found out that one of the scripts <a href="http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/nav.html?wp-includes/js/tinymce/wp-tinymce.php.html"><code>wp-tinymce.php</code></a> was being returned truncated. Because of that, <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> would report that some TinyMCE bullshit wasn&rsquo;t defined (JavaScript, oh I&rsquo;m not very fond of you). Oh, well. I tested calling that script under <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> separately and in fact, it was only returning a fraction of the script, 44K out of the actual 200+K. I also found out that even though my <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> installation had gzip compression enabled and the PHP had zlib as well, the script wouldn&rsquo;t process the <tt>tinymce.js.gz</tt> but it was returning directly <tt>tinymce.js</tt>. It&rsquo;s alright, I just wanted it to work, no matter if it wouldn&rsquo;t go through gzip, that&rsquo;d be a matter of some other day.</p>

<p>After a lot of googling I ended up reading <a href="http://www.republicavirtual.com.br/blog/2009/11/03/nginx-truncate-php/">this blog post</a> (in Portuguese), suggesting to make sure the file permissions for both the <tt>client_body_temp</tt> and <tt>fastcgi_temp</tt> directories allowed the user running nginx (<tt>www-data</tt> in my case) to write in them. Apparently large scripts would start writing to disk on them temporarily while processing the shit. Of course, you wouldn&rsquo;t have this issue if you are running an nginx from your operating system package manager (like <a href="http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=nginx">Debian</a>&rsquo;s), but this might very well happen when you are running a custom nginx with separate modules and all sorts of crap on top of it:</p>

<pre><code>chown www-data:www-data -R /usr/local/nginx/fastcgi_temp/;
chmod -R 777 /usr/local/nginx/fastcgi_temp/;
chown www-data:www-data -R /usr/local/nginx/client_body_temp/;
chmod -R 777 /usr/local/nginx/client_body_temp/;
</code></pre>

<p>Obrigado, <a href="http://www.republicavirtual.com.br/blog/">republicavirtual.com.br</a> :-)</p>
