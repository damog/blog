    	<p>I started working for <a href="http://www.booking.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Booking.com</a> two weeks ago now. These last two months have been probably the most chaotic and hectic in a long time from what I remember in my life. I left New York City, chilled out in Mexico City for several weeks and then finally relocated to beautiful Amsterdam. The decision of leaving New York was not simple, but I decided to take on new challenges, one cycle had ended for me and it was time for me to move on.</p>
<p>The change has not been easy, but it hasn’t been bad at all. I knew that coming from a very mutating startup in New York City into a company with presence in dozens of countries and several thousand employees was not gonna be a simple change. I decided to proceed with this because I want to learn. I want to learn how other businesses use technology, specially the kind that I’m most interested on, to become successful. I want to understand how they operate. I want to help a company succeed, take on new technology lessons and learn from more experienced peers. Thankfully, I’m not financially burdened and I’m able to make this decision myself without affecting (too much) others. I wanted the adventure (again) of relocating to a new country and making it to a company that has been successful for so many years, hugely based in Perl, who has contributed <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2012/01/bookingcom-sponsors-100000-to.html" target="_blank" rel="external">boldly</a> to its community, with so many great Perl developers in the mix, etc., just made it all worth it.</p>
<p>Being a new guy is never easy, and I haven’t really been one of those often. I wish I knew how a lot of things work already, so I was able to contribute faster. At the end, this is all about a business and it’s about what developers and engineers do to contribute, to give back, to produce something that ends up as revenue and profit, and I want to do just that. Benefits and perks are always nice, but what I really want is prove to myself and to those who hired me the kind of competent talent that I am.</p>
<p>If you can understand Spanish, this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/KHXiLURi4lA" target="_blank" rel="external">video</a> explains it better. </p>
<p>Oh and yeah, I turned 28 during my first week of work here in the Netherlands and was lucky enough to have a very happy one with plenty of hopes and goals.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    	<p>My professional career has been kind of an interesting one. I believe that when I diverted from being a completely stereotype of a geek, my career as an IT professional really took off. Or at least, the real experience: that experience that no words can describe on a resume but that only you have within, that experience that only comes up when you’re facing a real-life problem and no interviews or screening processes or algorithms challenges and tests can really discover. That experience really started emerging when, ironically, I started looking at work as a medium to get to a more fulfilled life, instead of the life itself. I stopped attending conferences for fun or just hacking mandatory GPL software, and started developing a different array of preferences. I believe that when I started doing that, I started learning more in favor of my previous employer. I didn’t see everything through the pragmatism of what other programmers (specially free software advocates that I was mostly involved with six to seven years ago) would think and started to enjoy what I do and how I did it. I started to learn from other people, to see how real life problems are approached and how they’re attacked and thankfully I did learn how a lot of those are solved. And how the entire scheme actually pays off.</p>
<p>I come with this preliminar description of my current professional career because I read, and you should too, a great masterpiece of a ranting about the <em>brogrammer</em> and geek/nerd stereotype overall, by Perl guru <a href="http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/" target="_blank" rel="external">mst</a>, called <a href="http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/neither-nerd-nor-bro/" target="_blank" rel="external">Neither Nerd nor Bro</a>. In it, he rants extensively about this <em>brogrammer</em> term and the whole nerd culture. Go read it. I’ll wait here.</p>
<p>You done? Good. I am of course <strong>not</strong> a brogrammer, don’t let the title of this post trick you. I believe that such a term is associated to failure just like a company could pretend to be cool enough to call its programmers something like ninjas or rockstars. Recipe for disaster. Why would anyone think of himself like a rockstar or a ninja? What’s the point for that? And is this only a recruiting technique by that people who don’t have a single hint of clue of technical knowledge and think they’re getting to real and actual A-player programmers?</p>
<p>I cannot do anything else but agree with what mst states. And I think the best programmers are those who don’t consider themselves like it. Good programmers, just like everyone else in life, are those who enjoy life and not those who pretend to be something they might not even be. I stopped attending conferences when I learned that I would enjoy seeing people kick each other on the groin more so I started spending money in watching <a href="http://ufc.com" target="_blank" rel="external">UFC</a> pay-per-views and whenever possible, come to live shows (believe me, they are expensive). But do not fail to encapsulate me on a “I’m so not a nerd that I want to choke you until you pass out to prove my manliness” speech. I also continued developing my passion for chess by joining a chess club and enjoyed chess tournaments. And when I started doing all of this alternative activities, my work, I believe, saw a peek in productivity. Doing what you love best, does affect your skills at work.</p>
<p>While the whole <em>brogrammer</em> term might be an entire joke, calling programmers rockstars is a fact and a reality and I couldn’t do anything more but despise those using the term and even more those owning it. In the hotbed that the whole Web startups have created in places like New York or Silicon Valley, you can be approached under those terms. As someone who has interviewed people for positions before and who has effectively hired people, I can say that you can definitively benefit more from passioned people who have other interests than those who are just pretentious fucks. I like people who might spend more time thinking about how to put that passion into a full-time endeavour. Those are legit. People who do what they love are the real deal. People who dream to do what they love and never lose motivation are the real deal as well.</p>
<p>Please be genuine. Peace.</p>

    	<p>I just recently quit my job at the startup company I had been working in for almost five years. In startup terms, such long time might be a whole lifetime, but in my case, I grew liking it more and more as the years came, I had evolved from being just another engineer, to lead a team of seven great developers, with decision-making tasks and strategy planning for our technical infrastructure. It’s been such a great long teaching journey that I’m nothing but pleased with my own performance, <a href="http://axiombox.com/lessons-learned-and-real-experience/" target="_blank" rel="external">learned lessons</a> and skills and all I provided and was provided by the project.</p>
<p>Leaving a city like New York is not an easy task. You have it all there, you start making a life and suddenly, before you know it, you already have a bunch of ties to the place, people, leases, important dates, all kinds of shit. Seriously, all kinds of crazy ass shit start to fill up your baggage. You wake up everyday to get into the subway and commute surrounded by all of this people that are just like you: so similar yet so immensely different. No, leaving the city is not an easy task, it’s not something to take lightly. You know how people just say “my cycle has ended in this place” as an euphemism not to end in bad terms with anyone? Well, ending a cycle is indeed a reality, I got to a point where I felt like I needed to head into a different direction, take on new challenges and overall, peace out and hope the best to everyone, specially to myself.</p>
<p>This was me, on my last day at work, last Friday of June:</p>
<p><a href="http://damog.net/old/axiombox/2012/07/damog-respect1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1322" title="damog-respect" src="http://damog.net/old/axiombox/2012/07/damog-respect1.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="426"></a></p>
<p>(Some) people seem to be anxious to know what I’m doing next, and my answer is, go mind your own fucking business. However, life is short and I would love to do any of the following:</p>
<p><ul><br>    <li>Go back to Brazil again, now as a blue belt in Brazilian jiujitsu, and train non-stop in Rio, this time as a local. I happened to come to Rio last November (as a four stripe white belt) and it’d been a great experience, with the <a href="http://www.connectionrio.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Connection Rio</a> guys. I kind of regretted not staying any longer, as a lot of people use to do, maybe three months. You don’t get to do anything else but train and roll with black belts on a daily basis, eat the healthy good stuff that a wonderful country like Brazil has to offer, hang out with amazing people and chill the fuck out all day long.</li><br>    <li>Make a road trip through Central America and get to know all of those countries where I’ve never been to even when I’ve travelled extensively around them for the last few years. I would head to the southernmost tip of Mexico and then take a bus to backpack travel in the cities all the way to Panama. Beer all along, a lot of swimming, plenty of heaven.</li><br>    <li>Head to any Russian consulate so I can get an entry visa for their amazing country and travel to any chess club on any of its big cities. Or maybe Hungary (do I need a visa to visit it?). Stay on small hostels where all I could use is a few good chess books and a chessboard, absorbe myself into chess sounds like a dream come true.</li><br>    <li>Stop procrastinating and write all the good Perl stuff I’ve wanting to do on my own time. All of those good projects I always thought of and only had opportunity to try at work but not on a giving-back-to-the-community kind of way.</li><br></ul><br>Decisions, decisions…</p>
<p>For the time being, I’m chilling with my people, friends and family in beautiful Mexico City. I’ve been doing so for the entire month of July and I couldn’t be more content. August will see my 28th birthday and as I approach thirty, I believe I need to continue moving forward.</p>
<p>This stupid world is a tiny place and our lives are short, I for one, will definitively try to take the bull by the horns.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, more updates soon. Peace.</p>

    </h1>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>There’s a <a href="http://blog.kraih.com/mojolicious-in-the-cloud-hello-heroku" target="_blank" rel="external">few</a> different posts out there on how to run Perl apps, such as Mojolicious-based, on Heroku, but I’d like to show how to deploy a <a href="http://perldancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Perl Dancer</a> application on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Heroku</a>.</p>
<p>The startup script of a Dancer application (bin/app.pl) can be used as a <a href="http://plackperl.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">PSGI</a> file. With that in mind, I was able to take the good work of <a href="http://bulknews.typepad.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Miyagawa’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/miyagawa/heroku-buildpack-perl" target="_blank" rel="external">Heroku buildpack</a> for general PSGI apps and hack it a little bit to use Dancer’s, specifically. What I like about Miyagawa’s approach is that uses the fantastic <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.5015/bin/cpanm" target="_blank" rel="external">cpanm</a> and makes it available within your application, instead of the monotonous cpan, to solve dependencies.</p>
<p>Let’s make a simple Dancer app to show how to make this happen:</p>
<p><code lang="bash"><br>/tmp $ dancer -a heroku</code></p>
<ul>
<li>heroku</li>
<li>heroku/bin</li>
<li>heroku/bin/app.pl</li>
<li>heroku/config.yml</li>
<li>heroku/environments</li>
<li>heroku/environments/development.yml</li>
<li>heroku/environments/production.yml</li>
<li>heroku/views</li>
<li>heroku/views/index.tt</li>
<li>heroku/views/layouts</li>
<li>heroku/views/layouts/main.tt</li>
<li>heroku/MANIFEST.SKIP</li>
<li>heroku/lib<br>heroku/lib/</li>
<li>heroku/lib/heroku.pm</li>
<li>heroku/public</li>
<li>heroku/public/css</li>
<li>heroku/public/css/style.css</li>
<li>heroku/public/css/error.css</li>
<li>heroku/public/images</li>
<li>heroku/public/500.html</li>
<li>heroku/public/404.html</li>
<li>heroku/public/dispatch.fcgi</li>
<li>heroku/public/dispatch.cgi</li>
<li>heroku/public/javascripts</li>
<li>heroku/public/javascripts/jquery.js</li>
<li>heroku/t</li>
<li>heroku/t/002_index_route.t</li>
<li>heroku/t/001_base.t</li>
<li>heroku/Makefile.PL<br></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you already know that by firing ‘perl bin/app.pl’ you can get your development server up and running. So I’ll just proceed to show how to make this work on Heroku, you should already have your development environment configured for it:</p>
<p><code lang="bash"><br>/tmp $ cd heroku/<br>/tmp/heroku $ git init<br>Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/heroku/.git/<br>/tmp/heroku :master $ git add .<br>/tmp/heroku :master $ git commit -a -m ‘Dancer on Heroku’<br>[master (root-commit) 6c0c55a] Dancer on Heroku<br>22 files changed, 809 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)<br>create mode 100644 MANIFEST<br>create mode 100644 MANIFEST.SKIP<br>create mode 100644 Makefile.PL<br>create mode 100755 bin/app.pl<br>create mode 100644 config.yml<br>create mode 100644 environments/development.yml<br>create mode 100644 environments/production.yml<br>create mode 100644 lib/heroku.pm<br>create mode 100644 public/404.html<br>create mode 100644 public/500.html<br>create mode 100644 public/css/error.css<br>create mode 100644 public/css/style.css<br>create mode 100755 public/dispatch.cgi<br>create mode 100755 public/dispatch.fcgi<br>create mode 100644 public/favicon.ico<br>create mode 100644 public/images/perldancer-bg.jpg<br>create mode 100644 public/images/perldancer.jpg<br>create mode 100644 public/javascripts/jquery.js<br>create mode 100644 t/001_base.t<br>create mode 100644 t/002_index_route.t<br>create mode 100644 views/index.tt<br>create mode 100644 views/layouts/main.tt<br>/tmp/heroku :master $<br></code></p>
<p>And now, run <tt>heroku create</tt>, please note the buildpack URL, <tt><a href="http://github.com/damog/heroku-buildpack-perl.git" target="_blank" rel="external">http://github.com/damog/heroku-buildpack-perl.git</a></tt>:</p>
<p><code lang="bash"><br>/tmp/heroku :master $ heroku create —stack cedar —buildpack <a href="http://github.com/damog/heroku-buildpack-perl.git" target="_blank" rel="external">http://github.com/damog/heroku-buildpack-perl.git</a><br>Creating blazing-beach-7280… done, stack is cedar<br><a href="http://blazing-beach-7280.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://blazing-beach-7280.herokuapp.com/</a> | git@heroku.com:blazing-beach-7280.git<br>Git remote heroku added<br>/tmp/heroku :master $<br></code></p>

    	<p><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Geo::PostalCode" target="_blank" rel="external">Geo::PostalCode</a> is a great Perl module. It lets you find surrounding postal areas (zip codes) around a given an amount of miles (radius), calculate distance between them, among other nice features. Sadly, I couldn’t get it to work with updated data and because the file its Berkely DB installer was producing was not being recognized by its parser, which bases off on <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/DB_File.html" target="_blank" rel="external">DB_File</a>. Since I was able to find <a href="http://damog.net/files/misc/zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004.zip" target="_blank" rel="external">working data</a> for the source of zip codes, I ended up hacking the module and producing a version with no Berkeley DB support.</p>
<p>So basically, and taken from the POD:</p>
<p><blockquote>RATIONALE BEHIND NO BERKELEY DB<br>On a busy day at work, I couldn’t get Geo::PostalCode to work with newer data (the data source <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~tjmather/" target="_blank" rel="external">TJMATHER</a> points <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/TJMATHER/Geo-PostalCode-0.07/INSTALL" target="_blank" rel="external">to</a> is no longer available), so the tests shipped with his module pass, but trying to use real data no longer seems to work. DB_File marked the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~tjmather/Geo-PostalCode-0.07/lib/Geo/PostalCode/InstallDB.pm" target="_blank" rel="external">Geo::PostalCode::InstallDB</a> output file as invalid type or format. If you don’t run into that issue by not wanting to use this module, please drop <a href="http://damog.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">me</a> a note! I would love to learn how other people made it work.</blockquote></p>
<p>So, in order to get my shit done, I decided to create this module. Loading the whole data into memory from the class constructor has been proven to be enough for massive usage (citation needed) on a <a href="http://perldancer.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Dancer</a> application where this module is instantiated only once.</p>
<p><tt>$ sudo cpanm <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DAMOG/Geo-PostalCode-NoDB-0.01/lib/Geo/PostalCode/NoDB.pm" target="_blank" rel="external">Geo::PostalCode::NoDB</a></tt> now!</p>

    </h1>
  

	</header>
	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>For the last few months, I’ve been ranting a little too much with <a href="http://selectablemedia.com" target="_blank" rel="external">our</a> engineering team about <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub</a>. These rantings, of course, didn’t come out of the blue. I haven’t been too satisfied with GitHub’s reliability lately since we use it for our daily development and constant deployment on our different staging environments and our own operation has been affected by their recent multiple technical difficulties. This has led me to analyze whether we really need them, why we started paying for their service in the first place and if it’s really necessary for our product development in the first place.</p>
<p>Being an startup that originated its main product on Ruby and Ruby on Rails, some of our initial engineers were more oriented towards Ruby and open source technologies. We started using GitHub because it was the natural and de facto choice. Creation of repositories and private contributors was easy and would put you up to speed with collaboration. As we grew in developers count, our repositories did too as well as different projects. We even brought a system administrator in place. Do we still need GitHub right now? I won’t be dropping Git as our main version control system, but what has GitHub provided my company and project in exchange for the $200 we are paying them every month? Is it only hype for a company to use it for their internal repositories? Or is it hype to use them for their open repositories?</p>
<p>The lack of site reliability on their side is what has led me thinking about whether we should still use them. What really concerns me is that they seem to have operational issues on a daily basis, they’re constantly announcing new hires, new pub meetings and new <a href="http://octodex.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Octocat</a> designs, and little effort has been shown about the technical operations. It sometimes amazes me how people is so much in love with GitHub to the point where I even find “liked” articles on their feed on Google Reader whenever they announce downtimes and br0kenage (now +1’s). It’s like people enjoy what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Are we using their issues functionality? The nice thread comments per commit, per line? Are we using pull requests? Are we using any of their actual offering compared to what a native Git server setup offers? No. The only thing is just pretty much the collaboration management, and even then, the “Groups” feature per organization is still lacking. The only main feature we use is the web browsing for the repos, which we can do with open source tools anyway. At the end, there’s other great GUIs for Git we also use on a daily basis, such as <a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/" target="_blank" rel="external">GitX</a> or <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tower</a> (and for now, yes, <a href="http://mac.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">GitHub’s GUI client</a>).</p>
<p>The issue they were attacked with last week makes me wonder whether they are the right organization to give us version control system services or we’re just using them because we haven’t know any better or even looked at our own resources (people and machines). Someone got commit access to an open source repository. What if it would have been a malicious user getting access to private repositories where passwords and other sensitive are stored? How serious is this company? $200 is not much for a startup to spend on a neat service, but when that provider seems to be more concerned about stickers or beer than fixing their tech operations from the inside out is when it gets worrying. I like to see how other similar services we’re using compare to GitHub, how stable they feel and how notorious that reliability is shown. For example, <a href="http://newrelic.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">New Relic</a> which we also use, seems rock solid and they don’t show issues at all. What’s the difference here anyway?</p>
<p>Site reliability is tricky anyway: when it’s faulty, it shows and screams because it affects business operations and reaches the entire company; when it’s working perfectly, the way it should, you can barely realize people are doing an stupendous job. GitHub, however, doesn’t seem to have this clear.</p>

    	<p>I’ve been busy.</p>
<p><a href="http://selectablemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">We</a>‘ve been building a next generation video ad serving platform with all of lessons and experience we’ve gained over the last couple of years and specially over last one. In an industry where there’s too much client demand there’s only a few key supply players doing a good job and we’ve identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We’ve kept ourselves busy.</p>
<p>Over the course of last year, especially on the second half and as far as this first quarter of 2012 has been running, aims for a new better product have made me reconsider what I thought I knew and what I thought I had to learn on an engineering point of view, about how to build not only regular or good software, but enterprise software. Having a startup background where dynamics are key, we’ve shifted into a more concise, long-term, sustainable technology where pieces need not to change easily, but at the same time, provide flexibility, customizable solutions for clients’ needs and that would allow us to continue growing.</p>
<p>Question for me has been whether all of what I thought I knew about Web dynamics, engineering and technology is what I really thought it was. How do you get to the point where you start using some sort of product to enable you to build another. How is that decision made in your head. What business decisions are made that affect the technology stack on the technology your peers are building, on the product you are taking care of to produce something usable. How are those decisions considered from a technology point of view, are they just passed along and executed or do they really carry along considerations from all points of the company.</p>
<p>A modern life Web engineer does not only write software. That person should also understand how the entire business stack works, why are positions covered around him and how are those dots connecting to provide a good solution for some one who pays to use it. The engineer has to understand that very well.</p>
<p>It’s amazing the amount of strategies that I’ve personally met and thought of over the time. Real life experience is invaluable, but basic understanding of how things work is what enables that, and some people sometimes seem to forget that. Are you paying overpriced developers because you’re using hyped technology? Are you putting enough thought on what you are building and what could lead to in terms of those bricks.</p>
<p>It is not a myth that when you learn and increase your knowledge on something, something else seems to open up and leave your mind with more questions. Learning more makes you realize you’re ignorant. And it’s only the ability and willingness to continue learning that would lead you to a much better thought process that could even eventually make you think that the answer to the question was just right there from the very beginning, from the basics.</p>

    	<p><a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">RVM</a> hates my guts. And it doesn’t matter, because I hate RVM back even more. Since I was technologically raised by aging wolfs, I have strong reasons to believe that you just shouldn’t have mixed versions of software on your production systems, specially, if a lot of things are poorly tested, like <a href="http://rubygems.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">most of Ruby libraries</a>, aren’t backward compatible. I was raised on a world where everything worked greatly because the good folks at projects like <a href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Debian</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Perl</a> have some of the greatest QA processes of all time, hands down. So, when someone introduces a thing like RVM which not only promotes having hundreds of different versions of the same software, both on development, testing and production environments, but also encourages poor quality looking back and looking forward, there isn’t anything else but to lose faith in humanity.</p>
<p>But enough for ranting.</p>
<p>I had to deliver this side project that works with the <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter API</a> and the only requirement pretty much was that it had to be both run from the shell but also loaded as a class within a Ruby script. And so I did everything locally with my great local installation of Ruby 1.8.7. When it came the time to load on the testing/production server I found myself on a situation where pathetic RVM was installed. After spending hours trying to accommodate my changes to run properly with Ruby 1.9.2, I set up a cron job using crontab to run my shit every now and then. And the shit wasn’t even running properly. Basically, my crontab line looked something like this:</p>
<p><code lang="bash"><br><em>/30 </em> <em> </em> * cd /home/david/myproject &amp;&amp; rake awesome_task<br></code></p>
<p>And that was failing, crontab was returning some crazy shit like “Ruby and/or RubyGems cannot find the rake gem”. Seriously? Then I thought, well, maybe my environment needs to be loaded and whatever, so I made a bash script with something like this:</p>
<p><code lang="bash"></code></p>
<h1 id="!/bin/bash">!/bin/bash</h1><p>cd /home/david/myproject<br>/full/path/to/rvm/bin/rake -f Rakefile awesome_task<br></p>
<p>And that was still failing with the same error. So after trying to find out how cron jobs and crontab load Bash source files, I took a look at <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DotFiles" target="_blank" rel="external">how Debian starts its shell</a> upon login. And while that didn’t tell me that much that I didn’t know, I went to look at the system-wide /etc/profile and found a gem, a wonderful directory /etc/profile.d/ where a single shitty file was sitting, smiling back at me, like waiting for me to find it out and swear on all problems in life: rvm.sh. /etc/profile is not being loaded when I just run /bin/bash by my crappy script, only when I log in, I should’ve known this. Doesn’t RVM solve the issue of having system-wide installations so the user doesn’t have to deal with, you know, anything outside of his own /home ?</p>
<p>So I had to go ahead and do:</p>
<p><code lang="bash"></code></p>
<h1 id="!/bin/bash-1">!/bin/bash</h1><p>source /etc/profile<br>cd /home/david/myproject<br>/full/path/to/rvm/bin/rake -f Rakefile awesome_task<br></p>
<p>And hours later I was able to continue with work. Maybe this will help some poor bastard like myself on similar situation on the future.</p>
<p>Of course one can argue that I could’ve installed my own RVM and its Ruby versions, but why, oh why, if it was, apparently, already there. Why would I have to fiddle with the Ruby installations if all I want is get my shit done and head to City Bakery where I can spend that money I just earned on chocolate cookies? My work is pretty simple to run with pretty much any ancient version of Ruby, nothing fancy (unless you call MongoMapper fancy). RVM is a great project that doesn’t solve an issue, but just hides some really fucked up shit on the Ruby community.</p>
