<p><a href="http://www.grep.be/blog/en/computer/debian/debgem">Wouter</a>, I find your thinking on <a href="http://old.blog.phusion.nl/category/debgem/">DebGem</a> a bit overreacted. I think you are taking the product and commercial efforts that a company make as the proposed solution we&rsquo;ve all been expecting for a similar problem, which is not. You are considering DebGem to be an outcome provided by the Ruby community, which is not, to this issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phusion.nl/about.html">Phusion</a> is obviously not the Ruby community, but part of it. How I see it, it&rsquo;s great: I applaud that more companies take a look at nice technologies and try to provide their own products. Since I do most of my work with both technologies (and others), Debian and Ruby, I find DebGem worth giving it a try, and if it solves the installation problems of some gems on different systems for me, my employer and the systems I maintain, why not pay for it. However that&rsquo;s all you can expect it to do, solve your gem installation problems and that&rsquo;s it, they are not proposing to change how gems are done or how Ruby libraries are implemented as packages in Debian, they are just a bridge, a shortcut, nothing else, nothing more. And if that bridge works and is well built and maintained, hurrah!</p>
