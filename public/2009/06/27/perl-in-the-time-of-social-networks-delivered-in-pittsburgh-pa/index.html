<p>I attended <a href="http://yapc10.org">YAPC|10</a> during this past week. The overall experience was quite particular, with ups and downs, but after all I made it back in one piece.</p>

<p>I rode a <a href="http://twitter.com/GreyhoundBus">Greyhound</a> bus on my crusade of saving a few bucks. I always had issues with buses, when I was a child I used to go from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celaya">Celaya</a> to Mexico City (and back) almost every weekend for a couple of years and I developed a phobia against the whole bus experience. Even though, getting to Pittsburgh from New York City was cheaper riding a bus than the other alternatives anyway, flying or train. Anyways, it was an awful experience that prevented me from being complete recovered after each travel leg.</p>

<p>Staying at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University">CMU</a> dorms was also a nice and pleasant experience, feeling for three days like I was a kid on a nice American college. I might want to do that some time in the future pursuing a Master&rsquo;s degree (some day).</p>

<p>At YAPC, I had the nice chance to get to know a lot of people I&rsquo;d only known by mailing lists and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> modules authors that I use on a daily basis. I also had attended <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2008/">YAPC 08</a> last year in Chicago, so I already knew a small group of mongers.</p>

<p>I delivered my talk about <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fyapc10.org%2Fyn2009%2Ftalk%2F2019&amp;ei=TNhGSsz2E4uMtgf2nO28Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOfDGg0lJfxNaCoXuwrHtWkMeutA&amp;sig2=3I6CebhFGNvJikg_451vbA">Perl and social networks</a> on Tuesday. I gave it an small twist by moving it into a more motivational, business perspective for hackers, in the last minute. I was overall satisfied with it, and I also think some things were not well done and had to be changed. Fortunately, quite some people came to me and gave good, positive, constructive feedback about it, that I was very thankful to receive, and unfortunately some people also threw destructive criticism that only makes you think how douche-baggy people in the community you can be. In any way, I was happy and satisfied, some observations:
<ul>
    <li>I have to take out a lot of personal stuff I poured into it because people don&rsquo;t care (and it&rsquo;s not their fault, it&rsquo;s mine).</li>
    <li>Focusing more on actual code. I can try to focus on motivating people to adventure into social networks application development using Perl, but the YAPC audience is more into actual development and coding techniques than money-making ideas.</li>
    <li>I still have to practice my speech. I took the time to write my lines scripts for each one of the slides, but that makes the interaction with the people a bit more difficult to establish.</li>
</ul>
And some interesting points around YAPC in general:
<ul>
    <li>In the auction, event that is done every year helping <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">TPF</a> raise some funds and that a similar approach would be great to have in conferences like <a href="http://debconf.org">DebConf</a>, the highest bid for a lunch with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> reached <strong>one thousand dollars</strong>. I was a bit surprised.</li>
    <li>They took us in a tour at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Field">Heinz Field</a>, home of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, it was awesome, although it was already a bit late and couldn&rsquo;t take good pictures of the field. Pictures are on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raquelydavid/sets/72157620471209726/">this Flickr set</a>.</li>
    <li>I had some time at the end of my stay in Pittsburgh so I took the opportunity to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnc_park">PNC Park</a> and watch the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> kick one of their greatest rivals (as I learned there, because of the proximity), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. Pictures are on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/raquelydavid/sets/72157620543866974/">this set</a>.</li>
    <li>Some people outside the venue also joined me on the conference as I setup an improvised ustream transmission. Unfortunately, I never got to press the &ldquo;Start recording&rdquo; button, so no video of it. Bummer. However, God willing, I will record my next delivery of the talk on <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/2028">YAPC::EU</a> in Lisbon, in early August.</li>
</ul>
I&rsquo;ve placed the slides on a PDF <a href="http://github.com/damog/perl-socnet/blob/master/Perl%20in%20the%20Time%20of%20Social%20Networks.pdf">here</a>. You can also clone the <a href="http://github.com/damog/perl-socnet">entire repository</a> containing the source Keynote file.</p>
