<main>
<p><p>This incoming week will be madness. Two main things will happen.</p>

<p>I’m giving a talk at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://fsl.glo.org.mx/">Festival de Software Libre</a> in Gualadajara, on thrusday. It will be about colaboration in free software projects, focused on Debian.</p>

<p>The other important thing to do is a physics exam on Friday, so it will be madness to cover both things, and try to not lose more classes than the ones I will, so this is my plan:
</p>
<li>
<strong>Monday 27 th.</strong>
I have to finish a homework for Tuesday, and it is long. I only have one day left for deliver it, so the entire day I have to work on it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tuesday 28 th.</strong>
Deliver my homework at 9 am, hopefully finished. Stay on that class until the end (around 11 am). Go the office (FYI I work in the university, so the office is pretty close from the classroom) and pick up my stuff (I’ve already informed I was missing almost the entire week).</p>

<p>Get on the bus with Tacvbo at 12:30&#160;pm. Then we’d spend <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> hours within the bus until we reach Guadalajara.</li>
<li>
<strong>Wednesday 29 th.</strong>
Watch Tacvbo’s talk about Gentoo and scream about its disadvantages <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"/>. The entire day, I would spend it finishing my presentation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Thrusday 30 th.</strong>
Give my talk at 11 am. Eat lunch at midday. Take a bus around 4&#160;pm in order to return to Mexico City. In the meantime, being in the bus, I <strong>have</strong> to study physics for my exam, that will be the only moment alone where I’m going to be able to study. Arriving estimated time: Midnight.</li>
<li>
<strong>Friday 1st Oct.</strong>
Wake up at 6 am for my Calculus class at 7, and my Physics exam at 9. Then I would go to work. Then, go to eat and spend the noon with Rachel.</p>

<p>That’s it. That is evil plan for this week. I hope I could post activities everyday. See ya!</li></p>
