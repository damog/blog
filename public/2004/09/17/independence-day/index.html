<p>Today, actually yesterday (September 16th), was Mexican Independence Day. A day like today, almost 200 years ago, 1810, <a href="http://www.mexonline.com/grito.htm">Mexicans</a> began their way to freedom. This year also, it is the 150th birthday of the Mexican Anthem, composed by Bocanegra and Nunó.</p>

<p>Obviously, that day is, nowadays, an excuse for drinking and celebrating. I really didn&#8217;t do anything on the eve. I stayed at home working on several things. I remembered, one year ago, <a href="http://ion.gluch.org.mx/">ion</a> came to Mexico City, from Chihuahua, and I took him to a party I was invited, stupidly far away from here, near to the exit to Cuernavaca, a city 80&#160;km to the south of the city. That was one of the worst parties ever.</p>

<p>Anyway, happy anniversary, <em>free</em> Mexico. ;-)</p>

<p>So, today was a holiday and nobody does anything on September 16th, so Raquel and I went to the movies. We watched <a href="http://www.lamalaeducacion.com/">La Mala Educación</a> by Pedro Almodóvar. That is a wild film, pretty cool, crude, rude, gay, twisted. A great movie, who else can make movies like Almodóvar? And the funny part: Gael García Bernal speaking Spanish accent all the time ;-)</p>

<p>So, tomorrow, because of today&#8217;s holiday lots of people do not work neither. They take the jump holiday, but I&#8217;m working tomorrow, besides, I couldn&#8217;t stand being on my house all day long.</p>

<p>There is no money anymore, so I think this weekend will be a calmed down one.</p>
