<p><p>I have received a couple of questions regarding of my use of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> instead of any other weblog system. It&#8217;s quite easy.</p>

<p>LiveJournal is a free software company, using free software to build a business. That&#8217;s widely cool, they are not the same kind of company that allows you to store a webservice and then gets yourself deep on spam. That&#8217;s ethic.</p>

<p>But, why am I using LiveJournal web service instead of <a href="http://jaws.com.mx/">jaws</a>, *Nuke or other web logs? Because I&#8217;m lazy to maintain a web site for my own. That&#8217;s well shown on damog.net cover page ;-)</p>

<p>I installed jaws some days ago, <a href="http://www.damog.net/blog">here</a>. I like it, but not too much, I really prefer to have something that I like the most, not just use because it was developed in Mexico, or by some friends: That&#8217;s the truth. I don&#8217;t like it to be so related to some stuff that nobody cares, but the developers (MVC, ERP, SOAP, etc, etc, etc&#8230;). It&#8217;s obviously a personal opinion.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago, I installed also <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo</a> to use it more like a organization framework, <a href="http://mambo.damog.net/">here</a>. It is extremely beautiful, those guys from graphic design rock, exploding lots of great features of JavaScript and web development.</p>

<p>Any way, I just changed the layout of my LiveJournal&#8217;s weblog. I like it, as I did with <a href="http://www.live365.com/">Live365</a>, I would probably buy a paid account, to support a little bit. What they say in their Paid Accounts page is a thought I really share:
</p>
<pre>Do I have to pay for using LiveJournal services?
No, of course not. Paying for web services is annoying, we agree.
That&rsquo;s why nearly all of LiveJournal&rsquo;s functionality is available
free of charge. However, if you&rsquo;re happy with the service you&rsquo;re
being provided, show your support and get a paid account.</pre>
<p>
So, why not? At least, at the end of month, when I receive my check from work ;-)
