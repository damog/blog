<p>Well, yeah. Lots of things has happened on the last days. Let&#8217;s start without particular order.</p>

<p>* My mother went ill because of pressure and stress. She, fortunately, is getting better. I have to start doing some things by myself, which she used to do.</p>

<p>* My DSL modem was fucked up by a ray storm. The thing is, the only thing that was fucked up was the ethernet port&#8230; It&#8217;s insane, because the USB port is still running. There is no other explanation, the storm made my modem sad :-( Anyway, <a href="http://www.mig-29.net/">MiG</a> had another DSL modem without using it, so he lent it to me, thank you MiG ;) I&#8217;m online again :)</p>

<p>* Yesterday, <a href="http://www.gnuowned.tk/">GnuOwned</a>, MiG and I went to Cuernavaca on my car. Our conversation deciding on going was something like this:</p>

<p>Damog: The northern point of the globe I&#8217;ve been in is Tepic, Nayarit.<br/>
GnuOwned (which is from Los Cabos, BCS): Actually, the southern point I&#8217;ve been in is this, Mexico City.<br/>
Damog: So you don&#8217;t even know Cuernavaca?<br/>
GnuOwned: No.<br/>
Damog: What about going there now? ;-)<br/>
GnuOwned: Ok! ;D</p>

<p>So, we went to pick up MiG (we called <a href="http://www.damog.net//">Tacvbo</a> up, but he was busy with his mother and sister) and toke way to Cuernavaca, which is a very nice city, clean, beautiful and the weather is just great. I wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble on moving there.</p>

<p>* And yes, I&#8217;ve been missing <a href="http://skwinklaa.tripod.com/paralectoresimpacientes/">her</a> too much, more than I could imagine.</p>
