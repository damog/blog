<p><p>So, as I already <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.livejournal.com/users/damog/12483.html">wrote</a> before, Dalai Lama was in Mexico for the last week, and on thrusday he was at college receiving an Honoris Causa Doctorate by the UIA-ITESO educational system. Funny guy.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to get into the main auditorium.
</p>
<li>A complete security system was installed in the university. Metal scanners were a PITA.</li>
<li>Invitation was required, a la Orkut. <img alt="tongue.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/tongue.png"/></p>

<p>Anyway, we could watch the event by video conference broadcasted by the university over the Internet.</p>

<p>So, I can’t remember really how I got into a very interesting “belief” quiz.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html">Belief-o-Matic</a> is a quiz for telling you what really religion you believe in. I really consider myself as everything but religious person, so I decided to go through the quiz.</p>

<p>Finally, the system told me I was a Mahayana Buddhist <img alt="bigsmile.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/bigsmile.png"/>, which I don’t know what that really means <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"/> There are lots of religions, some that many of you may never heard, like Neo Pagans, lol.</p>

<p>Anyway I don’t think I’m a complete Mahayana guy since they are more likely to be against things like abortion or homosexuals, which tend to be a very conservative stuff. According to BeliefNet, some of the occidental buddhist tend to accept that, although it is not well seen from oriental buddhists.</p>

<p>So, what religion, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html">according to Belief-o-matic</a> are you? <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"/>
</li></p>
