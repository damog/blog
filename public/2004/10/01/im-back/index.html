<p>Some great things happened.<br></p><p></p>
<li><br><strong>Day 1, tuesday</strong>. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://blog.tacvbo.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tacvbo</a> and I arrived Guadalajara around 7:15&#160;pm and wait for someone to pick us up for more than one hour. Finally, a very funny guy, Bernardo, picked us up. We went to the hotel, and then to have dinner with him, and two other guys.We had a nice dinner talking mainly about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Debian</a> or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.gentoo.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gentoo</a> <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png">. I tried a very nice pozole with chicken, it rocked.<br><br>As it was a little bit late, we went to the hotel again. Tacvbo worked a few minutes more on his presentation, and we finally felt down sleeping.</li><br><li><br><strong>Day 2, wednesday</strong>. Odin and Fermin came from Mexico City early in the morning. We all went to have some <em>tortas ahogadas</em> <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png">. And finally, we went to the Festival.There I met the very nice Patux, one of the main organizators of the event, and well, the event was pretty cool, the opening ceremony, the IBM talk, the Gentoo talk (given by Tacvbo), but specially the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.unix-power.net/amnesiac/docs/ruby.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Programming Elements on Ruby</a>, by my very good friend <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.unix-power.net/amnesiac" target="_blank" rel="external">Amnesiac</a>.<br><br>At night, we went to drink some beers, on a catina-style taqueria. There we met some other guys from the Festival, to my surprise, we found there <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://kad.gulags.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kad</a>, which is a very good friend from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://jaws-project.sf.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jaws</a> development <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://planet.jaws.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">team</a>.</li><br><li><br><strong>Day 3, thursday</strong>. A little bit of hangover. I woke up, toke a shower, woke up the other guys and received a phone call. It was Sandra, a very nice friend from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://yahoogroups.com/Godmakers" target="_blank" rel="external">Godmakers</a> mailing list. So we went to take a quick breakfast while the others decided to get themselves ready.I came back to the room, and as usual, Tacvbo was not ready. We were in our way to FSL around 10:30. My talk was at 11, so we arrived on time.<br><br>Giving my talk I realized the presence of one of the persons that made me happier to meet, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.kublun.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Wieland</a>. He was there only for a few minutes, but I was greatly happy with him going to see a part of my talk, which by the way, was fine.<br><br>So, he was there until I finished my talk, hang on with me and other guys and finially left to his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.iteso.mx/" target="_blank" rel="external">school</a>.<br><br>Then, we (Amnesiac, Tacvbo, Odin, Fermin and me) went to this sushi buffet that Amnesiac likes, it rocks, lots of variety of sushi :). Then, I took a taxi and went to the bus station, in my way home.<br><br>I can conclude that Guadalajara is a great city. Lots of <strong>pretty</strong> women there, nice hot weather, nice kindly people. But probably too heaven for me. I need more like a hell city, which finally I just got again. What am I going to do? <img alt="wink.png" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.damog.net/images/emoticons/wink.png"><br></li>
