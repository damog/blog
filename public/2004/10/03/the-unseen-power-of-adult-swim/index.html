<p>I recently noticed that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/">Cartoon Network</a>, one of my beloved TV channels, will (or is already) launch a new cartoon concept. At least, new for them.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/gen/asfaq/index.html">Adult Swim</a> is a block where they are broadcasting some cartoon <em>for adults</em>. They argue about the age of their audience, saying that more grown and mature people watch CN. That’s way, in a night block (from 11&#160;pm to 5 am) they are showing cartoon series such as Family Guy and Futurama, both <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.fox.com/">Fox</a> superhits, and some others like The Ripping Friends, a very nice show of ‘bad boys’ that I had the chance to watch once and Lupin The 3rd, which is the story of a thief.</p>

<p>I don’t really know if that would benefit CN or not. CN has been consolidated as a great cartoon maker, noted on Cartoon Cartoons, and broadcasting some old school shows. Because of that is the excellent audience they have now, including adult people. Now, it is probably some kind of mistake to change their shows because of that. If something is being successful between everybody, why change it?</p>

<p>So, I really don’t know if that is going to be broadcasted on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041018111240/http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/">Cartoon Network Latin America</a>, since LA population and probably audience tend to be more conservative. I hope Adult Swim reachs Mexico, at least.</p>
