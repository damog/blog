    	<p>Here it&#8217;s a top-10 list of <em>really important things</em>, created by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.msf.es/">Médicos Sin Fronteras</a> in Spanish. <a target="_blank" href="http://apebox.org/">directhex</a>, from #debian-offtopic (<em>thanks!</em>), provided a grammar/spelling check on my original English translation.<br></p><br><ol><br><li><br><strong>Central African Republic:</strong> Resurgence of the conflict. In 2006, its civilian population was a victim of violence again. During these months, confrontations have taken place between government troops and rebel groups. Civilians, suspected of supporting one or the other, have stuck in the biddle. Around 100,000 civilians have been forced to leave their homes. Several children, under 5 years old, have become ill of malaria, worms and serious respiratory infections.</li><br><li><br><strong>Chechnya:</strong> Physical and psychologic scars. The consequences of a conflict that has lasted over 12 years so far are still present. Large numbers of Chechens that were displaced during the most serious phases of the crisis have already returned. However, the majority still lack housing and has to live in temporary shelters. Violence, kidnappings and abuses are still rampant. In the rural zones, medical infrastructure is almost nonexistent.</li><br><li><br><strong>Sri Lanka:</strong> Civilians caught in the middle. Combat between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have intensified since the summer, causing displacements of tens of thousands of people. Other are still imprisoned and cannot flee.</li><br><li><br><strong>Democratic Republic of Congo:</strong> Violence and permanent deficiencies. Deprivation and violence suffered by millons of Congolese is still happening unnoticed by the rest of the planet. Eastern Congo is a battleground for fights between several armed groups, included government forces that use force against civilian populace, leading to brutal living conditions.</li><br><li><br><strong>Somalia:</strong> War and natural catastrophes. Even though its current situation has temporarily attraced media attention, the terrible living conditions of the Somali population are still largely forgotten. The country has one of the worst levels of sanitation in the world, and a quarter of the infant population dies before reaching 5 years old.</li><br><li><br><strong>Colombia:</strong> Living with fear. Massacres, executions and fear are a daily life of thousands of Colombians. So far, almost three million have fled their homes because of a conflict marked by the drug trafficking that involves government forces, paramilitary groups and armed guerrillas.</li><br><li><br><strong>Haiti:</strong> Extreme urban violence. The violence and insecurity is a daily breakfast in its capital city, Port-au-Prince, with confrontations between armed groups, the Haitian police and the UN Stabilization Mission on Haiti. Since December 2004, more than 3,000 people have been registered with bullet wounds, including more than a thousand women and children.</li><br><li><br><strong>India:</strong> 25 years of conflict. Confrontations between Maoist insurgents, government forces and anti-Maoist military services have caused the displacement of 50,000 civilans in several areas of the country. The population still lives with fear and violence, with little or no access to sanitary conditions.</li><br><li><br><strong>Tuberculosis:</strong> Obsolete and insufficient treatments. Against popular opinion in the West, tuberculosis is not an &#8220;obsolete problem&#8221;. Each year, it causes the deaths of two million people, around nine million people contract the disease, and new multiresistants variants are appearing.</li><br><li><br><strong>Undernourishment:</strong> Thousands of avoidable deaths. Whilst in Spain the Ministry of Health tries to fight one of the major problems of the decade, obesity, millions of children die of hunger around the world and more than 60 million people show signs of acute undernourishment.</li><br></ol><br><p><br>I guess not everything around is a top ten contest on popularity of who&#8217;s the hottest, who&#8217;s the prettiest, who has the longest penis or the biggest breasts, or whose farts smell better, geek, eh? </p>
