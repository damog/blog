    	<p>So, yeah, I’m in Edinburgh right now. For those of you who have asked, here is a little track of my adventures in the previous days:<br></p><br><ul><br><li>Saturday morning. I leave my apartment in Mexico City at around 4:30 am. Raquel takes me to the airport. We both realize how we could not work properly without each other.</li><br><li>Saturday, 1&#160;pm. Arriving in New York City. Given the time and the stupidly long line for passport/visa control, I drop my plans of visiting the city.</li><br><li>Saturday, 3&#160;pm. After getting used to the AirTrain at JFK, I finally find Terminal 4, in order to check whether FlyGlobeSpan is really there. I realize that screen in the terminal announce my flight as cancelled.</li><br><li>Saturday 5&#160;pm. We receive an explanation, that the company representing the airline in the airport did not receive the proper aircraft (!), so the flight was cancelled. We all get accommodation at the DoubleTree hotel near the airport. I blame and say bad words about the situation. My flight was being rescheduled to Sunday or Monday, upon availability.</li><br><li>Saturday 6:30&#160;pm. I was chatting with my people from the hotel room. I really love wifi.</li><br><li>Saturday 7&#160;pm. I take the hotel shuttle to get to the AirTrain and then get to the subway system in New York.</li><br><li>Saturday 8:30&#160;pm. Getting to Chambers St. in Little Italy, Manhattan. Walk a few blocks and have some pizza with some latinos. Realizing that they also sell pirate DVDs in NY’s metro and pirate lenses and hats on street markets. Have my first Budweiser.</li><br><li>Saturday, 9&#160;pm. After calling Raquel, I realize the time and in order to not miss time or whatever and given how tired I was, I decide to go back. I go up the subway on Essex station.</li><br><li>Saturday 11:30&#160;pm. On my way to Jamaica Station, which connecs to the AirTrain, they took us out of the train because it was their last stop (missing like 5 stations to get to the real last one). We get on a free shuttle. While waiting for it, I realize that most of the people there are Caribbeans and Mexicans, most people speak Spanish or a Caribbean English. Get on the shuttle. A black lady gets on and start telling Jesus is coming and we are all sinners, she gives people flyers on the holy things and the evil things. People (specially youngs, wearing sportswear) make fun at her, I only feel sorry. A latina rubbs a latino’s arms and admires his tattoos (both complete strangers that eventually met on the shuttle), while being invited to their party. Just as I said to Biella, it’s a bit outstanding to me since it’s the first time I’m in NYC and happen to be real what neighborhoods seem in the movies :-)</li><br><li>Saturday, 12:30&#160;pm. Finally got to the hotel, after being waiting for a taxi in some terminal at JFK. The hotel shuttle showed up and they brought me there.</li><br><li>Sunday, 11:00 am. I get a phone call from the reception hotel saying that checkout time is at 12. Hurry to shower, do some stuff and look for some other flights. I find a good price for a flight from NYC to Dublin, for that same day. Consider it, talk to Raquel about it and try to buy it. Not possible, my credit card is denied for some reason. Take the shuttle to the airport.</li><br><li>Sunday, 1:00&#160;pm. The AerLingus ticket sales are opened until 2:30&#160;pm (what kind of timetable is that?). Call their sales line, talk to a representative and I get the flight.</li><br><li>Sunday, 2:00&#160;pm. I’m waiting to check-in my luggage. Plane leaves at 17:40.</li><br><li>Sunday, 3:00&#160;pm. Having a Budweiser at some bar in the terminal. Have some pizza.</li><br><li>Sunday, 4:00&#160;pm. Buy a flight from Dublin to Edinburgh on RyanAir. The flight from NYC arrives at 6:00 AM on Monday and the flight to Edinburgh departes at 8:40 PM.</li><br><li>Sunday, 6:00&#160;pm. I take off from NYC and get on my way to Dublin, Ireland.</li><br><li>Monday, 6:30 am. I land at Dublin.</li><br><li>Monday, 8:00 am. After having a coffee and a donut I realize that the UK and Ireland does not use the EU power adapters, so I’m unable to get online or something because battery was empty. I sit on a couch and try to get some sleep.</li><br><li>Monday, 12:00. I wake up with a terrible neck and pack pain and realize that 8 hours are still missing. Start to read.</li><br><li>Monday, 15:00. After three hours of reading I’m tired and consider going to the city.</li><br><li>Monday, 16:00. Dropping the idea of going to the city I simply wait and wait and wait. I realize they drive from the right side of the car.</li><br><li>Monday, 18:00. I had overweight on my luggage. I took the bottles from the checked-in luggage and was pretending to take them with me. They tell me I’m not allowed to carry them anymore. They tell me that the cost of the extra weight would be €40. Decide to drop them. The lady tells me that I could bring one to the luggage. I give her a tequila Azul. I drop the third bottle on the toilet. The mezcal worm goes in circles until it’s gone.</li><br><li>Monday, 21:00&#160;pm. I take off from Dublin.</li><br><li>Monday, 21:45&#160;pm. I land at Edinburgh.</li><br><li>Monday, 22:15&#160;pm. I’m on my way to Teviot. I find Edinburgh to be just another reality of life, with all its incredible landscapes, buildings and streets. I realize that people indeed use kilts (Scottish skirts, for those like me unfamiliar with the term) without underwear.</li><br><li>Monday, 22:40&#160;pm. I find all people coming out from Teviot on Bristo Square. I join some Venezuelan buddies. Everybody heads to the Chesse and Wine party. Go to the hostel with Orlando and leave my luggage on the room.</li><br><li>Monday, 23:30&#160;pm. Join everybody in the party and have some nice red wines, Chinese (yes, not Japanese) sake, tequila, Cuban rum.</li><br></ul><br><p><br>After all, I had made it to DebConf7. </p>
