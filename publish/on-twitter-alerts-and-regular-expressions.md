I don't know if I'm the only one that does something like this, but I certainly <em>trust</em> I'm not alone.

I love regular expressions (to which some people say there's nothing <em>regular</em> about) and I just found <a href="http://tweetbeep.com">TweetBeep</a> recently, which is a simple alerts system. There's nothing really new or innovative about it, given that you can get the results yourself using advanced search on Twitter and consuming the results from a feed. However, I for sure, I don't want to spend time setting any of that up, and they do that quite easily, which is the whole difference, ease of use. You can get the results on time intervals via mail. Rocks.

So, one of my alerts is about regular expressions: I'm receiving <em>everything</em> Twitter tweets about them, whether <em>regex</em>, <em>regexp</em>, <em>regexes</em>, <em>regexps</em>, etc. are mentioned, I get them. Now, I feel a bit nerdish/dorky about it given that I like to reply on those tweets on totally random people and try help them whenever it's possible (or just learn a bit more from other regex gurus), but what the hell.

Now, the good thing about this is that being a "good person" and fellow <em>regex</em> buddy with people is starting to pay off. Whether I'm getting new very interesting followers, I also found a nice opportunities niche to take advantage of, and a couple of gigs have come up. I worship building strong relationships with people (as in long-term clients), and when starting to get to know some persons via a common interesting thing such as a regular expressions is just awesome, little piece of awesomeness.

For the geeky part of this post, if my regular expression Twitter alert had to be written as a regex, this would be it:
<blockquote><tt>/regex(?:(ps?|es))?/</tt></blockquote>
The questions now is, should I start following <tt>/regular\s*expres{1,2}ions?/</tt> too? Maybe I will :-)
