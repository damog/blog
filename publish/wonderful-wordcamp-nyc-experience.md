Let me put it again in bold, <strong>I had an awesome experience</strong> yesterday at <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp NYC</a>. If you ever have the opportunity, you shouldn't miss the chance to attend <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">one of them</a>, it's really inspiring, people is very, very welcome and I loved the fact that there's so many people with all sorts of backgrounds and focused on many fronts on the Web and blogging world, not just technical.

During the course of this starting week, I'll be posting my notes and remarks on each one of the talks I attended, I believe they do require their own attention. With as much as <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/program/saturday-schedule/"><em>eight</em> simultaneous tracks</a>, it was pretty much impossible to hear them all, so I focused on technical talks (<em>go figure</em>) and on the "beginning developer" track, since I pretty much knew close to nothing when it comes to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> core development.

Unfortunately I couldn't attend <a href="http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/program/sunday-schedule/">Sunday sessions</a> due to health issues. I'm seriously sorry about that. Anyhow, to be honest, I cannot easily recall another conference that left me with such a nice feeling after attending it.

Also, expect more blogging here. :)
