<p>Some kind of irregular happiness has taken my soul today. This is probably the effect of a sun day, or maybe the end of the semester. Anyway I like even the color of the school&#8217;s grass, it is a pure green, a true color of nature. Smooth.</p>

<p>The only true is that I am happy :-).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been making a little research on digital image processing, and I have found several nice features of PNG and MNG, anyway, it&#8217;s nice.</p>

<p>Nothing else to say today. Over.</p>
