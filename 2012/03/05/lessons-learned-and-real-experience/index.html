    	<p>I’ve been busy.</p>
<p><a href="http://selectablemedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">We</a>‘ve been building a next generation video ad serving platform with all of lessons and experience we’ve gained over the last couple of years and specially over last one. In an industry where there’s too much client demand there’s only a few key supply players doing a good job and we’ve identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We’ve kept ourselves busy.</p>
<p>Over the course of last year, especially on the second half and as far as this first quarter of 2012 has been running, aims for a new better product have made me reconsider what I thought I knew and what I thought I had to learn on an engineering point of view, about how to build not only regular or good software, but enterprise software. Having a startup background where dynamics are key, we’ve shifted into a more concise, long-term, sustainable technology where pieces need not to change easily, but at the same time, provide flexibility, customizable solutions for clients’ needs and that would allow us to continue growing.</p>
<p>Question for me has been whether all of what I thought I knew about Web dynamics, engineering and technology is what I really thought it was. How do you get to the point where you start using some sort of product to enable you to build another. How is that decision made in your head. What business decisions are made that affect the technology stack on the technology your peers are building, on the product you are taking care of to produce something usable. How are those decisions considered from a technology point of view, are they just passed along and executed or do they really carry along considerations from all points of the company.</p>
<p>A modern life Web engineer does not only write software. That person should also understand how the entire business stack works, why are positions covered around him and how are those dots connecting to provide a good solution for some one who pays to use it. The engineer has to understand that very well.</p>
<p>It’s amazing the amount of strategies that I’ve personally met and thought of over the time. Real life experience is invaluable, but basic understanding of how things work is what enables that, and some people sometimes seem to forget that. Are you paying overpriced developers because you’re using hyped technology? Are you putting enough thought on what you are building and what could lead to in terms of those bricks.</p>
<p>It is not a myth that when you learn and increase your knowledge on something, something else seems to open up and leave your mind with more questions. Learning more makes you realize you’re ignorant. And it’s only the ability and willingness to continue learning that would lead you to a much better thought process that could even eventually make you think that the answer to the question was just right there from the very beginning, from the basics.</p>
